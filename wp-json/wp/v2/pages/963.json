You also understand that distributors make independent decisions on what books to make available and, depending on the content or any other basis, distributors may choose not to distribute your books.<\/p>\n<p><em>More simply put: We use AI to help you to produce and distribute your book. Our services are provided via our website.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>2. <\/strong><strong>Modification.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>We reserve the right, at our discretion, to change these Service Terms at any time, and to modify, correct, amend, improve, discontinue or make any other changes to the Services at any time and for any reason.

You may be required to review and accept such changes by ticking the provided confirmation box and\/or as otherwise instructed by us. If you do not accept the updated Terms, your access to the Site may be restricted until you do so. Any change to these Service Terms will be effective once approved by you as set forth above, except that, in the event of non-material changes, such changes will be effective ten (10) days following posting of the revised Terms on the Site, and your continued use of our Services thereafter means that you accept those changes.

You agree that Spines shall not be liable to you or to any third party for any such modification, suspension, or discontinuance of the Services.<\/p>\n<p>For clarification, we will not change the content of your Books (as defined below), unless requested by you and subject to these Service Terms. Notwithstanding the above, we will not increase the amount charged to you for production of a Book, or decrease your royalty percentage for such Book, following your purchase of our Services to produce such Book.

If you are under 13 years, please do not use the Services. If you are between 13 and 18 years of age, then you must review these Service Terms with your parent or guardian before using the Services to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand these Service Terms and agree to them.<\/p>\n<p><em>More simply put: Our services are not offered to individuals under the age of 13.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>4. <\/strong><strong>Payments and Credits.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>4.1. Fees. By joining our Services, you agree to pay the fees set out in our Pricing Page as applicable to your chosen Services (together with any other payments hereunder, the \u201c<strong>Fees<\/strong>\u201d). The Fees are subject to the following terms:<\/p>\n<p>4.1.1. Unless local regulation requires that the Fees be inclusive of applicable taxes, customs and duties, the Fees are and shall be exclusive of all taxes, customs and duties, which shall be solely borne by you.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.2. You may cancel your Plan(s) (including the Add-ons and Upgrades) in accordance with our Cancellation Policy available at <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/cancellation-policy\/\"><em>https:\/\/spines.com\/cancellation-policy<\/em><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/cancellation-policy\/\"><em>\/<\/em><\/a>, as amended from time to time (the \u201c<strong>Cancellation Policy<\/strong>\u201d). If a material change in the Cancellation Policy occurs, we will provide you with notice of the material change and information regarding how to cancel your Plan(s). Please note that Spines does not offer any option to place your Plan on hold.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.3. Fees may be subject to up front or installment payments (of all or part of such Fees), as set forth during the Plan onboarding process (\u201c<strong>Process<\/strong>\u201d). We may offer you an option of paying in installments of the applicable production Fees when you join a Production and the Membership Subscription Plan. All payments under these Service Terms shall be made via the payment method specified during the Process. If not otherwise specified in the Process, Fees are charged instantly.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.4. It is hereby clarified that we reserve the right to report any unpaid Fees to credit bureaus, and\/or otherwise take any necessary action in connection with the collection of unpaid Fees.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.5. Delivery of Services begins upon project onboarding and\/or your receipt of the initial deliverable (such as a manuscript draft, proof, or access to the Spines platform). Your continued use of or participation in the Services constitutes your acceptance of the Services. The period in which a book is ready for publication will vary depending on the extent of revisions needed, your timeline, and how involved you are. You acknowledge and agree that project timelines depend on your responsiveness, and that delays caused by your lack of feedback, approvals, or required materials shall not be considered non-delivery of the Services by Spines.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.6. Revisions of your Books during the production process may be subject to additional payment if the applicable production step was already approved by you. For example, once you have proofread your manuscript and approved the manuscript copy as final, further revisions to your manuscript may be subject to additional payment. In addition, if you request that we replace the currently distributed version of your Book with a new version of the applicable Book, an additional fee shall apply.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.7. Provided that you have paid the total of the applicable Fees, you will be entitled to submit your Book for production within one (1) year from the commencement date of your Production Plan and\/or within any other time frame authorized by us in writing following your request (\u201c<strong>Submission Period<\/strong>\u201c). You also understand that work on your manuscript will only commence once you have approved the book\u2019s production, and will only proceed to future stages once the previous stage is approved. For example, formatting will only take place once you have approved the grammar and spell-check. The book will only be published once you have approved the final product and we have this in writing.\u00a0 Following such Submission Period, we will provide our Services only subject to an additional payment of the applicable Fees (at our then-current rates).<\/p>\n<p>4.1.8. We may offer discounted fees for subsequent Books submitted by you, as presented at the author dashboard at <a href=\"https:\/\/dash.spines.com\/loginPage\"><em>https:\/\/dash.spines.com\/<\/em><\/a> and provided you have joined a Membership Subscription Plan.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.9. Credits. Certain packages, as indicated on the Pricing Page, may contain monetary credits that may be used for PPC activations and campaigns.\u00a0 These credits must be activated within one year of the commencement of your package and, once activated, must be used within one month thereafter. You will forfeit these credits if not used within the time limits described above.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.10. In order to pay your Fees, you will be required to provide accurate and up-to-date billing information, including your payment card number, expiration date, billing address, and any other relevant billing details (\u201c<strong>Billing Information<\/strong>\u201d) to our third-party payment processor. You are responsible for ensuring that your Billing Information is complete and accurate at all times. You agree to immediately notify us of any change in your billing address or payment information.<\/p>\n<p>4.1.11. <strong>AUTO RENEWAL TERMS: Unless terminated in accordance with the Cancellation Policy, Membership Subscription Plans shall automatically renew for successive membership subscription periods, at the then-current Fees set out at our pricing page, at <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/pricing\/\"><strong><em>https:\/\/spines.com\/pricing\/<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong>. Each renewal period will be equal to the initial Membership Subscription period unless otherwise specified at the time of purchase. Spines will notify you prior to such automatic renewal: the specific start and end dates of your Membership Subscription, as well as the renewal date and the date by which you must cancel your Membership Subscription Plan to avoid being charged for the next renewal period, will be provided to you in your confirmation email. If the Fees change, you will be notified in advance of the renewal and will have the opportunity to cancel before the new Fees take effect. You acknowledge that if you fail to submit a cancellation request following these notifications related to the autorenewal terms, you will not have grounds to request a chargeback. You may terminate your Membership Subscription Plan at any time via the author dashboard on the Site, subject to the Cancellation Policy, which is available at: <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/cancellation-policy\/\"><strong><em>https:\/\/spines.com\/cancellation-policy<\/em><\/strong><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/cancellation-policy\/\"><strong><em>\/<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong>. Following our receipt of your timely Cancellation Notice (as defined in the Cancellation Policy), your Membership Subscription Plan will not renew. You may contact us, if necessary, by the following means: (a) online, via the Site (<\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.spines.com\"><strong><em>www.spines.com<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong>); or (b) by e-mail: <\/strong><a href=\"mailto:admin@spines.com\"><strong><em>admin@spines.com<\/em><\/strong><\/a><strong>. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><em>More simply put: Our services are offered for payment. You can cancel your Plan in accordance with our Cancellation Policy. You will receive a notice from us before your Membership subscription renews. Your Plan automatically renews unless you cancel them in accordance with our Cancellation Policy. We may charge you more if you ask us to replace the distributed version of your book with another version. You have one year from when you joined our services to submit your book to our website.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>4.2. Sales Royalties. Subject to your payment of the applicable Production Plan Fees, you are entitled to receive 70% of the Net Sales Royalties (defined below) received by Spines from the distribution of your Books and, depending on the ongoing promotions or campaigns, the potential to receive up to 100% of the Net Sales Royalties in the first year and a minimum of 70% in the second year, once such Net Sales Royalties exceed, in the aggregate, US $25 (with respect to all of your distributed Books) within the period applicable to your Membership Subscription Plan (which may be on a weekly, monthly or quarterly basis, as set forth during the Process) (such period, the \u201c<strong>Payout Period<\/strong>\u201d). The term \u201c<strong>Net Sales Royalties<\/strong>\u201c means gross revenue received by Spines, less any applicable taxes. Net Sales Royalties payment will be calculated in accordance with a periodic sales report we will provide you, if applicable, via the Site with respect to each applicable Book, following the end of each applicable Payout Period (provided that sales have occurred within such Payout Period) (the \u201c<strong>Periodic Sales Report<\/strong>\u201c).<\/p>\n<p>Once Net Sales Royalties have exceeded US $25 in the aggregate (with respect to all of your distributed Books), in order to be entitled to the above royalties you must submit a payment withdrawal request (\u201c<strong>Payment Withdrawal Request<\/strong>\u201c) via the Site. You are permitted to make Payment Withdrawal Requests at any time during the Term and for sixty (60) days thereafter. After this point, you may continue to receive royalties but no report is able to be provided with such payment. If applicable, royalty payments will be made, following the processing of your Payment Withdrawal Request, in accordance with the terms set forth in the Periodic Sales Report. We may require you to provide additional documentation if required by applicable law in order to process your Payment Withdrawal Request. We shall be entitled to deduct from the royalties payable to you any sums that you may owe us at any time. Following payment of Net Sales Royalties (if any), your balance will be reset.<\/p>\n<p><em>More simply put: If you have joined a Membership Subscription Plan, we will issue periodic sales reports regarding the sale of your book(s), accessible via the website. After a net amount of US$ 25 is received, you will be entitled to withdraw your royalties. You must withdraw your payments yourself using the website.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><strong>5. <\/strong><strong>Materials we provide.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>5.1. Materials.

Prior to publication, all edits and revisions to your Book will only be made with your approval. Following your approval of a Book&#8217;s publication and\/or distribution, no changes, alterations and\/or other corrections to a Book shall be permitted, unless agreed by Spines in writing. Spines may require you to pay an additional fee for making such approved changes, alterations and\/or corrections, as further set forth in Section 4.1 above.<\/p>\n<p><em>More simply put: We can decide whether or not to publish or distribute the books (or other materials) you submit to our website. We can also decide to remove books posted on the website at any time.

Ownership. You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary rights and permissions to use and to authorize Spines to use all Intellectual Property Rights (defined below) in and to your Books, and to enable inclusion and use thereof as contemplated by the Site and these Terms.

Our Ghostwriting service is designed to help you bring your book to life by working with a professional writer who will create original content based on your ideas, outlines, or instructions. The services include one-on-one sessions which are conducted remotely.<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>7.1. <strong>Background; Payment; Recordings.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Our Writing Coach Services are intended to assist you in your writing process by providing one-on-one coaching sessions, each lasting one hour. Our Ghostwriting Services are intended to assist you by providing professional writers who will work with you to create original content for your book based on your ideas, outlines, or instructions. The Writing Coach Services and Ghostwriting Services are collectively referred to as the \u201cWriting Services\u201d. Each service will only be available to those who purchase the specific service. Please note that payment must be made prior to your use of the Writing Services.<\/p>\n<p>You must use the first Writing Service within three months of purchase. The Writing Services must be used in their entirety within nine months of purchase. Any unused sessions after this period will be forfeited.<\/p>\n<p>Sessions will be conducted through Google Meets (or any other standard video or relevant media platform) and retained for a year in an encrypted drive.<\/p>\n<p>You understand that we will offer advice on your manuscript if so requested, but that all final decisions on the text are your responsibility, and that we are not responsible for the final text.<\/p>\n<h3>7.2. <strong>Ownership.<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>You retain all of your ownership rights in and to your books and any other material you provide to us during your use of the Writing Services.\u00a0 We will use this material solely to provide the Writing Services to you.

In addition, as part of the Writing Coach Services we may provide you with guides or other written documents (collectively, \u201c<strong>Guides<\/strong>\u201d) that assist you in improving your writing craft. We will continue to be the exclusive owners of these Guides, and we grant you a worldwide right and license to use them for your personal use.

Spines shall not be liable to you or any third party for termination of the Services.

General.<\/h3>\n<p>These Terms, together with the Website Terms, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Spines concerning the Services.
