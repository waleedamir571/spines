If you self-publish, you will have to do most of the work on your own to make it happen. When you work with a traditional publisher, on the other hand, then the company will typically do most of the work for you in exchange for a percentage of the profits and royalties. At the same time, you retain the majority of the rights to the content. We break down the three common ways you can publish your book below.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Traditional Publishing\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The oldest and most popular approach involves submitting your <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Manuscript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">manuscript<\/a> to a publishing house, hoping they will fund its publication and sale. In return, the publishing house receives a significant portion of the net profit.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on the financial risk they have to take in publishing your work, their net profit may range from 85 to 95 percent of the sale, leaving you with only 5 to 15 percent royalty. In other words, they\u2019ll sell your book for a dollar, and you&#8217;ll possibly end up with a nickel. The upside is that they&#8217;ll take care of production, distribution, marketing, and all other costs.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, the traditional way of publishing can be risky because you lose control over the content. Your publisher can change your book, and sometimes the final product is nothing like the original. Your contract may allow the publisher to change, remove, or shuffle certain parts of your book as they please, and you will have no recourse or veto power.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Self-Publishing\u00a0<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/what-are-self-publishing-companies-and-why-are-they-so-popular\/\">Self-publishing is a route that has become increasingly popular<\/a> for new authors to get their material on bookshelves. Here, you publish your book without the help of a major publishing company, either through digital publishing or offset printing. This option will require you to spend a considerable amount of money at the start because you won&#8217;t have a publishing house to help with the upfront costs. Depending on your desired number of copies and your target profit, the cost can be anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000. Here&#8217;s a quick breakdown:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Editing and Formatting \u2013 $4,000 (60,000-word manuscript)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Layout and Cover Design \u2013 $1,500<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Printing and Distribution \u2013 Variable (depends on the number of copies)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ISBN \u2013 $100 to $300 (depends on the code type)<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, keep in mind that you are not entirely on your own in your self-publishing journey, and there are ways to reduce the cost and save money. So, how much does it cost to publish your book? Well, thanks to platforms that offer <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/\">self-publishing services<\/a> like Spines, you have a chance to publish your book without draining your bank account, even offering a free <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-copyright-certificate\/\">copyright certificate<\/a> upon uploading your manuscript.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They offer everything you will need to publish and sell your book, from <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-proofreading\/\">book proofreading<\/a> and editing to marketing and sales &#8211; and provide you with step-by-step guidance from start to finish. They also <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-distribution\/\">distribute your book<\/a> over 100+ distribution channels, including Amazon, Barnes &amp; Nobles, Baker &amp; Taylor, BAM and Ingram Group.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Simply put, you can publish your book in a fraction of the time, and at a fraction of the cost as a traditional publishing house. Not to mention, you\u2019ll get up to 70 percent royalties, compared to the 5 to 15 percent <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-royalties\/\">book royalties<\/a> you typically get if published through conventional means.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How Much Does It Cost to Publish Your Book?\u00a0 Before novels like The Bridges of Madison County and You Can Heal Your Life became all-time bestsellers, the authors of these books went through the tedious and costly process of self-publishing.
