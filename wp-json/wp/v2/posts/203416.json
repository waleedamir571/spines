You\u2019ve poured your heart into your manuscript, but now the real challenge begins: navigating the world of ISBNs, trim sizes, cover options, royalties, and distribution channels. It\u2019s enough to make even the most seasoned writers want to hide under a pile of unfinished drafts. But take a deep breath\u2014you\u2019re not alone in this journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thankfully, you don\u2019t have to figure it all out by yourself. Two heavyweights in the print-on-demand (POD) world, <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong> vs <strong>KDP Print<\/strong>, are here to lend a hand. Each <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/book-distribution-101-a-guide-for-new-authors\/\">book distribution<\/a> platform offers distinct advantages to help you get your book from your computer screen to the hands of readers worldwide. The only tricky part? Deciding which one is the best fit for you and your book. Don\u2019t worry, though\u2014we\u2019ll break it down, side by side, and help you figure out which path leads straight to your publishing success (and which ones have dead ends you\u2019ll want to avoid). Let\u2019s dive in!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXdMceH1vcXD8_9BRP8qUiqJy2HDzmy2Ce4nAPng1jXOlr8lYXJhecxY1e6Tj0OA0IJXPwm1EEsfaFxG7ogctD5F2HHQ_JQSteR95-9LxwISAJeqWy2BLs6ijlQTFV2wMmAEJtcm5BoneCp2BYByCb_xeSo?key=MfVKUngdKpseL8ATpoC9Dw\" alt=\"Compare IngramSpark vs. KDP Print\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Overview of IngramSpark and KDP Print<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s set the stage. On one side, you have <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong>, a service known for its wide distribution reach and professional-quality printing. It\u2019s the go-to platform for those who dream of seeing their book on the shelves of bookstores and libraries.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>On the other side, we have <strong>KDP Print<\/strong>, Amazon\u2019s self-publishing platform that allows you to quickly and easily get your book printed and listed on Amazon\u2019s marketplace. It\u2019s perfect for authors who want to focus on the giant that is Amazon and aren\u2019t too worried about other retailers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which one suits your goals? Well, it depends. Many authors choose to utilize both KDP and IngramSpark to maximize their reach and publishing potential. Let\u2019s dive into the details.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Kindle Direct Publishing (KDP Print) Features<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazon KDP Print is a dream for those who value simplicity. Upload your manuscript, choose your trim sizes, select the cover, and boom\u2014your book is ready for the world of Amazon. Oh, and did I mention you get a <strong>free ISBN<\/strong>? No upfront costs mean it\u2019s friendly to those on a budget.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But (there\u2019s always a but) KDP Print\u2019s distribution is a bit limited. Sure, you\u2019re on Amazon, the world\u2019s largest bookstore, but don\u2019t expect your book to pop up in local shops or libraries without some extra hustle. However, if <strong>Amazon domination<\/strong> is your goal, KDP Print is your best friend.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>IngramSpark Features<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>IngramSpark takes things up a notch, offering <strong>hardcover<\/strong> options (yes, you can feel fancy with a hardcover!) and <strong>wider distribution<\/strong>. With IngramSpark, your book can reach not only Amazon but also <strong>bookstores and libraries<\/strong>, and who wouldn\u2019t want to see their title on the shelf of their favorite indie bookstore?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a catch, though. IngramSpark charges a fee for its services, including <strong>ISBNs<\/strong> and setup costs. But the trade-off is worth it if you\u2019re aiming for a professional look and <strong>wider reach<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Expanded Distribution: IngramSpark vs. KDP<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to distribution, IngramSpark is the winner for authors who want to break free of Amazon\u2019s ecosystem. IngramSpark allows you to distribute through retailers like <strong>Barnes &amp; Noble<\/strong>, indie bookstores, and even libraries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>KDP, on the other hand, dominates <strong>Amazon<\/strong>, and while it does offer <strong>expanded distribution<\/strong>, its reach to physical bookstores is more limited. If you\u2019re aiming for <strong>wider distribution<\/strong>, IngramSpark is your best bet. But if you\u2019re happy focusing on just Amazon sales, KDP Print keeps things simple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfXqPbbzgmXemz15diF0xloDRiKuUnI8WblsVauTIZeyPevikIlhGgz1i-_l7upiUY2QIm8ExIjbRg2VfQcVgq-5lXlFwckbmkSWu9gSSJpSlITNJdaT7vOzkyTLD57MYRkGMs6bQm7JWh0qDojpW407iyU?key=MfVKUngdKpseL8ATpoC9Dw\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cost Comparison: IngramSpark vs. KDP Print<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We know self-publishing can feel like hemorrhaging money, so let\u2019s talk costs. <strong>KDP Print<\/strong> wins on upfront costs with its free-to-use model. You only pay once your book starts selling, and Amazon takes a cut of your royalties. However, having your own ISBN when publishing on platforms like KDP and IngramSpark ensures greater flexibility in distribution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong> has setup fees for each title, which can seem pricey upfront. But with IngramSpark, you can set your own price, adjust <strong>wholesale discounts<\/strong>, and have more control over your profits in the long run. It\u2019s a bit of a trade-off: pay more now for greater flexibility later.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Print Quality and Format Options<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both platforms offer various <strong>trim sizes<\/strong>, but <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong> edges ahead with its <strong>hardcover<\/strong>, <strong>color printing<\/strong>, and diverse <strong>paper options<\/strong>. If you\u2019re publishing a <strong>children\u2019s book<\/strong> or a full-color photography book, IngramSpark\u2019s quality might better suit your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>KDP Print<\/strong> sticks to <strong>paperbacks<\/strong> and black-and-white interiors. It\u2019s perfect for novels, memoirs, and standard text-based books. If you want simplicity and <strong>don\u2019t need fancy paper types<\/strong>, KDP Print works just fine.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ease of Use and Accessibility<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KDP Print is undoubtedly the more <strong>user-friendly<\/strong> platform to self publish your work. You don\u2019t need to be a tech wizard to navigate it, and the setup process is quick. <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong>, on the other hand, requires a bit more technical know-how. The learning curve is steeper, but if you\u2019re willing to put in the time, the flexibility pays off.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<p>For first-time authors, <strong>KDP<\/strong> is your low-stress option. For more seasoned authors (or those with a bigger distribution dream), <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong> offers more options but takes a bit more elbow grease.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Marketing and Promotion Services<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>KDP Print integrates seamlessly with <strong>Amazon Ads<\/strong>, making it easy to run paid promotions. Since you\u2019re already on Amazon, the world\u2019s largest retailer, this is a major perk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When comparing self publishing services, IngramSpark doesn\u2019t offer the same level of built-in marketing, but it does provide <strong>metadata optimization<\/strong> to ensure your book is discoverable. For authors looking to market outside of Amazon\u2019s ecosystem, <strong>IngramSpark\u2019s wider reach<\/strong> offers more opportunities for <strong>organic discovery<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfP7fufjxTLuyPSYi_S_Up73yoC-R6BBhhMoLQWuMe-7rMOwIQCWN2-O2KDJ8HYWwS-A42qg62Us0oaNJIeTAomFF0POn8R3oubje-SgZH1j_iJXbNEQPcBzFOFh--HhgLKgn6o8HaXD17lwvSJPtt7c7Ed?key=MfVKUngdKpseL8ATpoC9Dw\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Which Print-On-Demand Service is Best?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, which platform is best for self published authors? <strong>KDP Print<\/strong> is the ideal choice if you\u2019re looking for a <strong>hassle-free experience<\/strong> and are happy with your book living primarily on <strong>Amazon<\/strong>. On the flip side, <strong>IngramSpark<\/strong> is the right option if you want <strong>wider distribution<\/strong> and <strong>hardcover printing<\/strong>, and don\u2019t mind paying a bit more upfront.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But wait\u2014what if neither platform quite fits your vision?
