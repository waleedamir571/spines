But the real question is, how many people are actually reading books these days?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it may seem like everyone\u2019s glued to their phones, binge-watching the latest show, or scrolling endlessly through social media, the reality might surprise you. In fact, many people still read books regularly\u2014yes, actual books, not just status updates or tweets. But how many full books do people read a year? Is it really the dozen or so we all claim at the start of each new year\u2019s resolution? Or are we reading less than we think?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this article, we\u2019re diving into the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/exploring-self-published-authors-sales-statistics\/\">numbers, the trends, and some truly surprising facts<\/a> about reading. From e-books to audiobooks, and the way book lovers have embraced social media, reading habits are changing\u2014but they\u2019re not disappearing. So sit back, grab a cup of tea (or maybe even a book), and get ready to discover just how much reading is still going on in the world today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Bookworm is Still Alive!<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 1: 48.5% of U.S. Adults Read One Book Annually<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a world dominated by streaming binges and endless social media scrolling, books face stiff competition, yet nearly half of American adults still engage with them. According to 2022 data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.arts.gov\/stories\/blog\/2024\/federal-data-reading-pleasure-all-signs-show-slump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Endowment for the Arts<\/a>, 48.5% of adults read at least one book for pleasure annually, down from 52.7% in 2017 and 54.6% in 2012. While this represents a notable decline over the past decade, it underscores a persistent cultural foothold for reading despite digital distractions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The \u201cBookworm Club\u201d today spans diverse formats- Kindle highlights, podcast-style poetry, and audiobooks during commutes. While the 48.5% figure doesn\u2019t sound very promising, it still represents over 100 million Americans <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/multimedia-storytelling-in-childrens-books\/\">prioritizing books amid a digital deluge<\/a>. Initiatives like the NEA Big Read, which leverages community art projects and youth programming, aim to reverse declining trends by reimagining literary participation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gender Gap is Not Just About Income<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 2: 49.2% of women report reading literature regularly, compared to just 29.5% of men<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, the gender gap is alive and well\u201449.2% of women report reading literature regularly, compared to just 29.5% of men, according to the 2023 National Endowment for the Arts report. So, what does this mean for the average bookworm? Well, it\u2019s clear that women are leading the charge when it comes to diving into books, whether it\u2019s novels, poetry, or non-fiction. But does this mean that men are less interested in reading altogether? Not exactly\u2014they might just be more selective about what they pick up.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Women tend to read more <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/the-best-selling-book-genres-and-why-they-succeed\/\">across a variety of genres<\/a>, from romance to historical fiction to self-help. Men, on the other hand, may focus more on specific genres like business, fantasy, or science fiction. While women might have a stronger presence in literature overall, men still enjoy reading, just in their own unique ways.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfpxXBYPieWK1D-rlk4FLoF61yBJfynvwAeDylWe007kPDDqbGBjRI7OKYeUVdKyKNseJUpcLUPBJBjPUQA18vzZ6fLPqdhC1bZzn8uSRAHSKRWGhafBMkyZZ9gS_5BvHpAZRhi5g?key=ANR8LKU6wBllWLLvejtpwiUU\" alt=\"A person with a thoughtful expression, resting their hand on their chin, while reading something on a laptop in a cozy, realistic living room setting.

In 2024, the global <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mordorintelligence.com\/industry-reports\/e-book-market\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">e-book market reached a significant $17.16 billion<\/a>, and it\u2019s expected to grow at a steady 4.78% annually, projected to hit $22.76 billion by 2030. While e-books are making their mark, they still haven\u2019t displaced physical books as the preferred choice for most readers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let\u2019s not forget the rise of hybrid reading habits, where readers switch between physical and digital formats based on the situation. This suggests that rather than one format replacing the other, both can coexist. E-books are here to stay, but the readers who prefer print aren\u2019t going anywhere either. Whether you&#8217;re team Kindle or team Hardcover, it\u2019s clear: <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/modern-book-distribution-from-print-to-digital\/\">reading comes in all shapes, sizes, and formats<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Audiobooks Are Winning Hearts\u2014and Ears<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 4: Audiobook revenue in the U.S. hit $2 billion<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The audiobook industry is booming! In 2023, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.edisonresearch.com\/audiobook-revenue-and-the-number-of-listeners-continue-to-grow\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">audiobook revenue in the U.S. hit $2 billion<\/a>, marking a 9% annual growth and continuing an impressive 11-year streak of expansion. About 38% of American adults listened to at least one audiobook last year, reflecting how deeply audiobooks have embedded themselves in today\u2019s reading habits. While they don\u2019t yet rival the overall dominance of print and e-books, they\u2019re certainly reshaping how people engage with stories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/do-audiobooks-count-as-reading\/\">do audiobooks count as reading?<\/a>\u201d debate rages on. Some purists might argue that <em>listening<\/em> doesn\u2019t count, but let&#8217;s be real\u2014experiencing a story through your ears is just as valid as turning the pages. So, if you\u2019re clocking in audiobooks while on the go, don\u2019t let anyone tell you you\u2019re not really \u201creading.\u201d Audiobooks are here to stay, and they\u2019re only getting more popular as they offer a new way to enjoy books in our fast-paced world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bookstagram and Booktok Are Changing the Reading Game<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 5: 2.4% of total U.S. Book Sales were made through Booktok Recommendations in 2021<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>BookTok has become a true game-changer in the world of books.

While this generation may be stereotyped as glued to their phones, it turns out they\u2019re picking up more physical books than their Millennial counterparts. Gen Z buys an average of 2.1 print books per month, compared to 1.8 per month for Millennials, according to data from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ala.org\/sites\/default\/files\/advocacy\/content\/tools\/Gen-Z-and-Millennials-Report%20(1).pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">American Library Association and Library Journal<\/a>. This preference for physical books has fueled a significant surge in print sales, especially in genres like YA and fantasy, with 61 million books purchased by UK Gen Z readers in 2023 alone, accounting for 18% of the market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This generation\u2019s reading habits are driven by both print nostalgia and a desire for digital-first discovery. They\u2019re reading books for <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/free-writing-as-therapy\/\">mental health benefits<\/a>, connecting with diverse voices, and enjoying the communal aspect of book recommendations through social media. Whether it\u2019s physical books or digital platforms like Wattpad and Libby for audiobooks, Gen Z is embracing a format-agnostic approach, proving that reading is alive and well, no matter the medium.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Screen Time Isn\u2019t Killing the Book<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 7: 662 million digital items were borrowed from libraries in 2023<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While it\u2019s true that screen time is impacting traditional reading habits, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/book-launch-events-virtual-book-tours\/\">the relationship between digital content and reading is more complex than we might think<\/a>. Digital reading is actually on the rise\u2014especially in formats like e-books, audiobooks, and digital magazines. In 2023, 662 million digital items (e-books, audiobooks, and magazines) were borrowed from libraries, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.libbylife.com\/2024-01-04-a-look-back-at-2023-a-record-breaking-year-for-digital-libraries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">marking a 19% year-over-year increase<\/a>. So, while screen-based activities like social media and videos are definitely competing for our attention, it\u2019s clear that digital reading formats are thriving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, screen time may be displacing traditional book reading, but it\u2019s not killing it\u2014it\u2019s just reshaping it. Today\u2019s readers are adapting by blending formats, finding new ways to consume stories, whether on paper, through audiobooks, or via their phones. The future of reading isn\u2019t gone; it\u2019s just evolving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Reading Helps Reduce Stress<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 8: Reading can reduce stress by 68%<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In today\u2019s chaotic world, we\u2019re all looking for ways to unwind, and it turns out that reading is one of the most effective stress relievers. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/blogs.ncl.ac.uk\/medlit\/2023\/01\/19\/reading-reduces-stress-fact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a 2009 study from the University of Sussex<\/a>, reading can reduce stress by an impressive 68%\u2014and all it takes is just six minutes. That\u2019s right, in under 10 minutes, you can feel noticeably calmer, with reading outperforming other common relaxation activities like listening to music (61%), sipping tea or coffee (54%), walking (42%), or even playing video games (21%).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does it work? Reading provides a powerful cognitive escape, engaging the brain&#8217;s prefrontal cortex, which activates the brain&#8217;s \u201canxiety brake,\u201d reducing those emergency stress responses. It also lowers heart rate and muscle tension, shifting focus away from everyday stressors. But the benefits don\u2019t stop there. Long-term, reading helps buffer against psychological distress, allowing us to cope better with life\u2019s frustrations. So, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/overcoming-writers-block\/\">the next time you\u2019re feeling frazzled<\/a>, don\u2019t underestimate the power of a good book.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXc3DqAwzP7HqoM9wSYhY726OxOBinBnV1_EIDPL2pic8gEEV77nKcGUkQoPxNnkg_BAvn_UMNodNkbGaE0c5Lbt50CqLRr5WPOtytDYvNixhY_wempniww2MhWm04r6IBJOGpOy?key=ANR8LKU6wBllWLLvejtpwiUU\" alt=\" A group of young people sitting together in a cozy, casual setting.

In Sweden, <a href=\"https:\/\/europe-data.com\/2024\/08\/16\/what-european-country-reads-the-most-books\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">80% of adults read at least one book annually<\/a>, with 21.5% reading 10 or more books per year (Eurostat 2022). Similarly, Finland leads the EU with 22.7% of its population reading 10 or more books each year. These Nordic countries have ingrained reading into their cultures through policies like free library access and parental reading programs, making books a central part of daily life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the other end of the spectrum, India presents a paradox: despite spending the most time reading globally\u201410 hours and 42 minutes per week\u2014book reading, particularly in higher education, is on the decline. The country faces significant access challenges in rural areas, even as literacy rates improve, with 86.2% literacy in 2023. <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/global-book-distribution-strategies-growing-your-reach\/\">Global reading trends show a complex landscape<\/a> where cultural priorities, educational systems, and access to resources shape how reading habits develop across different regions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Print Books Maintain Market Dominance Despite Digital Growth<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact 10: Print books still dominate the U.S. market at 80% of unit sales.<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the rise of digital formats, print books continue to dominate the U.S. book market, accounting for approximately 80% of unit sales. In 2024, 782.7 million print books were sold, representing a slight increase of less than 1% from the previous year, and a 10% increase compared to pre-pandemic levels (2019). Adult fiction is a major driver of print growth, with genres like fantasy and romance seeing notable increases in sales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This trend isn\u2019t just about a decline in print; it&#8217;s a shift in format and hybrid consumption. Gen Z, for instance, buys 2.1 print books per month but also reads webnovels on their phones. While digital formats have <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/writing-for-niche-genres-how-to-find-your-audience\/\">carved out niches in genres<\/a> like romance and fantasy, print books, especially in these genres, continue to thrive\u2014just look at Sarah J. Maas\u2019 <em>A Court of Thorns and Roses<\/em>, which sold over 1.3 million print copies in 2024. In short, while digital formats are expanding, print books remain the cornerstone of the book market, adapting alongside digital trends without being eclipsed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Fact: Reading is Very Much Alive<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading is far from dead\u2014it\u2019s thriving, just in new and exciting ways. Whether you&#8217;re flipping through the pages of a classic paperback, listening to an audiobook during your commute, or enjoying an e-book on your phone, reading continues to evolve with the times. As digital formats like audiobooks and e-books become more integrated into our daily lives, the joy of reading remains at the heart of it all. It\u2019s clear that books\u2014no matter the format\u2014still offer a powerful escape, a chance to unwind, and a way to connect with new ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s even more exciting is how readers are embracing this evolution. People are finding new ways to read\u2014whether by discovering books through BookTok or using apps like Libby to borrow digital titles from libraries. In fact, reading habits are more dynamic than ever, with <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/book-format-conversion-simplifying-the-process\/\">people blending formats to suit their lifestyles<\/a>. Gen Z, for instance, is buying more print books than ever while also enjoying webnovels and audiobooks, showing that reading isn&#8217;t confined to one format.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether you&#8217;re a die-hard fan of the physical book, an audiobook enthusiast, or an e-reader aficionado, there\u2019s a format for everyone. Reading is thriving in every corner of our lives, and it\u2019s never been easier to dive into a good story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, how many books are you going to read this year?
