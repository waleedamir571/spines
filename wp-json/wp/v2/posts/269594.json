Before you even see the first sad puppy\u2019s trembling eyes, you <em>know<\/em> you\u2019re about to cry. The ASPCA ad unfolds: slow-motion shots of shivering dogs, heartbroken kittens, and a solemn plea to \u201chelp now.\u201d Next thing you know, you\u2019re reaching for your wallet (and a tissue).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does this happen? Why do we get <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/creating-engaging-characters-in-fiction-a-writers-guide\/\">misty-eyed over fictional characters<\/a>, tear up at a speech, or feel a lump in our throats during a movie? The answer: <strong>pathos.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does pathos mean? Simply put, it is the art of persuasion through emotion. It\u2019s what makes us feel joy, sorrow, anger, or inspiration when we read, watch, or listen to something. Aristotle\u2014who basically invented persuasive strategy\u2014identified pathos as one of the three pillars of persuasion, alongside ethos (credibility) and logos (logic). Whether it\u2019s a heartfelt eulogy, a political speech, or an ad that guilt-trips you into donating to a cause, pathos tugs at our heartstrings and makes us <em>feel<\/em> something.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the trick\u2014how do you use it without veering into cheesy, eye-roll territory? (Because not every speech needs a dramatic tear-drop moment.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pathos Definition: More Than Just Feels<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what is it? At its core, pathos is the art of persuasion through emotion. It\u2019s the reason a well-timed speech can inspire revolutions, a tragic <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/balancing-action-and-emotion-in-romance-novels\/\">novel can leave us sobbing<\/a>, and a dramatic movie monologue can send chills down our spines. In short, it makes us <em>feel<\/em>\u2014and that feeling makes us act, believe, or remember.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term itself comes from Aristotle, the original authority on persuasion. In his work <em>Rhetoric<\/em>, he laid out the holy trinity of persuasion: <strong>ethos, pathos, logos<\/strong>\u2014credibility, emotion, and logic. When do we see the pathos definition in literature? It\u2019s when writers use emotion to connect with their audience. Think of Mark Antony\u2019s \u201cFriends, Romans, countrymen\u201d speech in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/13006.Julius_Caesar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Julius Caesar<\/em><\/a>\u2014a masterclass in riling up a crowd with grief and outrage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, it\u2019s not just for old-school plays and classic speeches. Modern movies, books, and even commercials thrive on it. Take <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/25856606-the-fault-in-our-stars?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=mmC1NcUMc1&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>The Fault in Our Stars<\/em><\/a>\u2014a novel designed to make you cry in public. Or <em>The Pursuit of Happyness<\/em>, where Will Smith\u2019s emotional breakdown hits you right in the soul. Even Pixar has perfected the art of emotional manipulation (<em>cue the first 10 minutes of<\/em> Up).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing\u2014pathos isn\u2019t just about making people cry. It\u2019s about stirring <em>any<\/em> strong emotion: excitement, nostalgia, even righteous anger. When done well, it can be the difference between a forgettable message and one that stays with you forever.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXcvIDIVgAl912q19hhpd8NXpIsQvy82UAScqLJjdeU_r19TPcUQUN42X8xW4tM5VHA2daX1wcR5xJ8xfOfmLWt4Xp43ohupHkqlotyLgK8NHvMQHGHOcP_muiBozLwdlUuncRKlDw?key=RZtMu7nzLmtmsyDUJwS0DIpk\" alt=\"A doctor in a white coat standing with their hand on their chin, deep in thought, in a medical office setting.\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Ethos, Pathos, Logos: The Power Trio of Persuasion<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If persuasion were a superhero team, it would have three unstoppable members: <strong>ethos, pathos, and logos.<\/strong> These three rhetorical strategies\u2014coined by none other than Aristotle\u2014work together to convince, inspire, and move audiences. Use them wisely, and you\u2019ve got <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/bilingual-childrens-books-reach-multilingual-audiences\/\">the power to influence the masses<\/a>. Use them poorly, and, well\u2026 cue the dramatic overacting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s how they work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Ethos (Credibility):<\/strong> \u201cTrust me, I know what I\u2019m talking about.\u201d This is all about <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/non-fiction-book-cover-design\/\">establishing authority<\/a>. A doctor giving medical advice? That\u2019s ethos. A lawyer giving legal advice? Also ethos.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pathos (Emotion):<\/strong> The pathos definition can only be characterized as <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/writing-fiction-that-captures-heart-a-beginners-guide\/\">the emotional pull that makes people care<\/a>. It\u2019s why politicians tell heart-wrenching personal stories and why movies throw in a tragic backstory five minutes before a big death scene.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Logos (Logic):<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/research-techniques-for-writers-ensuring-authenticity\/\">Facts, stats, and cold, hard reasoning<\/a>. Logos convinces the brain, while pathos tugs at the heart. (\u201cAccording to studies, 9 out of 10 dentists recommend this toothpaste\u201d = logos.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the greatest pathos examples? Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.npr.org\/2010\/01\/18\/122701268\/i-have-a-dream-speech-in-its-entirety\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">I Have a Dream<\/a>\u201d speech. He blends ethos (his role as a civil rights leader), logos (the injustice of segregation, backed by history), and pathos (vivid imagery, hope, and a call to action). And it still resonates today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But beware\u2014overuse it, and you risk slipping into melodrama. Ever seen a movie where the music swells <em>too<\/em> dramatically, the tears are <em>too<\/em> intense, and you\u2019re left thinking, \u201cOkay, we <em>get<\/em> it\u201d? That\u2019s pathos gone rogue. <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/balancing-action-and-emotion-in-romance-novels\/\">Balance is key<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When Words Make Us Feel<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Pathos is everywhere\u2014books, movies, speeches, commercials\u2014anywhere people want to stir emotions. Whether it\u2019s making you cry, laugh, or feel a sense of injustice, pathos examples are all around us. When done well, it\u2019s powerful. When overdone, it turns into an eye-roll-worthy melodrama (<em>ahem, soap operas<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Literature: Tears Between the Pages<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Ever read a book that left you emotionally wrecked? Classic literature is packed with pathos<strong> <\/strong>moments designed to pull at your heartstrings. Think of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/56916837-to-kill-a-mockingbird?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=6Uylrxhoid&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>To Kill a Mockingbird<\/em><\/a>\u2014Atticus Finch\u2019s courtroom speech isn\u2019t just logical, it\u2019s deeply emotional, making readers <em>feel<\/em> the injustice of racism. Or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodreads.com\/book\/show\/890.Of_Mice_and_Men?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=eEM9bZMrdx&amp;rank=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Of Mice and Men<\/em><\/a>\u2014that final moment between George and Lennie? Pure heartbreak. If you didn\u2019t shed at least one tear, check for a pulse.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Movies: From Pixar Gut Punches to Titanic Wrecks<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If Pixar has taught us anything, it\u2019s that animated films can emotionally destroy us. The first ten minutes of <em>Up<\/em>? <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/multimedia-storytelling-in-childrens-books\/\">A masterclass in storytelling<\/a> and pure, unfiltered sadness. And then there\u2019s <em>Titanic<\/em>. Jack and Rose\u2019s tragic love story was already emotional, but that infamous \u201cNever let go, Jack\u201d scene? Instant emotional overload. (Side note: There was totally room on that door.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Ads: The Good, the Bad, and the Hilariously Manipulative<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Commercials are experts at pathos. Some go straight for the tear ducts (<em>ASPCA\u2019s sad puppies<\/em>\u2014enough said). Others use uplifting emotional storytelling\u2014like Nike ads that make you want to start training for the Olympics immediately. And then there are the funny ones: Super Bowl commercials often use humor as a form of emotional connection with viewers. Because sometimes, laughter is just as persuasive as tears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/writing-romance-how-to-create-stories\/\">a heartbreaking novel<\/a>, a powerful speech, or a cleverly crafted ad, it makes us care\u2014and that\u2019s what makes it unforgettable. You may forget the exact words that were used, but you will never forget how they made you feel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Using Pathos Like a Pro<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you want to use pathos to captivate your audience without making them roll their eyes? Good call. When done right, emotional appeal can make your message unforgettable. But when overdone, it can feel manipulative, cringey, or straight-up exhausting. Let\u2019s break down the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Sweet Spot: Emotion Without the Overkill<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What does pathos mean in practice? It means <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/book-writing-for-character-personality-words\/\">making people <em>feel<\/em> something<\/a>, but in a way that\u2019s authentic. You don\u2019t want your audience to think, <em>Wow, that was powerful,<\/em> and then immediately, <em>Wait, was I just emotionally tricked?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is <strong>balance<\/strong>:<br><em>Balanced:<\/em> A heartfelt personal story that connects to a bigger idea.<br><em>Unbalanced:<\/em> A five-minute dramatic pause while staring into the distance, waiting for tears.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tips for Writers, Marketers, and Speakers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Writers:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-to-write-vivid-book-descriptions\/\">Use vivid imagery<\/a>, relatable experiences, and real stakes. Think about the emotions your audience already has\u2014then tap into them.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketers:<\/strong> People buy based on emotion,and then justify with logic. Want to sell a car? Show a dad tearing up as he hands the keys to his teenager (pathos), <em>then<\/em> mention the safety features (logos).<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Speakers:<\/strong> Tell stories. A well-timed anecdote or personal struggle can make your speech memorable. Just don\u2019t force it.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Puppy Test: Are You Using Pathos Correctly?<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your emotional appeal involves a puppy, ask yourself:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Is this relevant?<\/strong> (<em>ASPCA ad? 100% yes. A law firm commercial? Probably not.<\/em>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Is it over the top?<\/strong> (<em>One sad puppy: effective. A montage of 50 sad puppies: manipulative.<\/em>)<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Does it serve a purpose?<\/strong> (<em>Emotion should support your message, not distract from it.<\/em>)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>At the end of the day, it works best when it\u2019s genuine. Make people feel something real, and they\u2019ll never forget your message.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXea_Dm-hCL6AggUpp9rO4__uXFxNjxOXDKt29-3nn8YZ87w-btn1iqoCvWLV3S6zCj-AK1M6aK71zfI0ro20EKdmC_ITU6SMDgaJvgT1QyRLpD_Hkpz0K0oh38dtmZ6YGnfFWWLRQ?key=RZtMu7nzLmtmsyDUJwS0DIpk\" alt=\"Three friends sitting on a couch, laughing and enjoying each other\u2019s company in a cozy living room.\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Heart of Storytelling<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From literature and movies to speeches and marketing, the emotional storytelling device is everywhere. It\u2019s the secret sauce that <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/creative-story-ideas\/\">makes a novel unforgettable<\/a>, a speech inspiring, and a commercial just manipulative enough to make you reach for your wallet. When used correctly, this isn\u2019t just about making people cry\u2014it\u2019s about making them <em>care<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in the end, what is pathos, really? It\u2019s the emotional core of storytelling. Without it, speeches would be dry, movies would feel hollow, and ads would be nothing more than robotic sales pitches. Logic (logos) and credibility (ethos) matter, but emotions are what make people take action. We donate because we feel empathy. We protest because we feel outraged. We remember because we feel connected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>And let\u2019s be honest\u2014we live in a world that often prioritizes <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/research-techniques-for-writers-ensuring-authenticity\/\">cold facts and hard data<\/a>. But numbers alone don\u2019t inspire change. The emotional reaction does. It\u2019s why a single heartbreaking story can be more powerful than a statistic. It\u2019s why a great novel can stay with you for years. It\u2019s why a well-crafted speech can move nations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now, it\u2019s your turn. Whether you\u2019re writing, speaking, or selling an idea, go forth and make people <em>feel<\/em> something. Just, you know, maybe don\u2019t overdo it with the sad puppies.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to master the art of storytelling?

While it is often associated with sadness (<em>think tragic movie scenes or heartbreaking speeches<\/em>), it actually covers a <em>wide range<\/em> of emotions. It can make people feel joy, nostalgia, anger, pride, or even humor. A well-placed joke or an uplifting story can be just as powerful as a tearjerker when it comes to persuasion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q2: What is the difference between pathos and ethos?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pathos<\/strong> appeals to emotion (<em>makes you feel<\/em>), while <strong>ethos<\/strong> appeals to credibility (<em>makes you trust<\/em>). If a doctor tells you smoking is bad because they\u2019re a medical expert, that\u2019s ethos. If they share a moving story about a patient who suffered from smoking-related disease, that\u2019s pathos. The most persuasive arguments use both.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q3: Is a metaphor ethos, pathos, or logos?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>A metaphor itself isn\u2019t tied to one category, but it\u2019s <em>often<\/em> used in pathos. <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/metaphors-and-similes-in-book-writing\/\">A well-crafted metaphor can create an emotional connection<\/a>, making complex ideas more relatable. Example: Saying, \u201cHer heart was shattered into a thousand pieces\u201d evokes <strong>pathos<\/strong>. If a metaphor is used to clarify logic (<em>e.g., \u201cThe brain is a computer\u201d<\/em>), it leans more toward <strong>logos<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q4: What is a false pathos?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>False pathos is when emotional appeal is exaggerated, manipulative, or deceptive\u2014essentially, emotional trickery. Think of political fear-mongering, fake sob stories in reality shows, or commercials that exploit sadness <em>just<\/em> to sell products (<em>cue overly dramatic music and slow-motion puppy tears<\/em>). When the rhetoric is forced or insincere, people see right through it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q5: Is pathos a fallacy?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Not inherently, but it <em>can<\/em> be. The appeal to emotion fallacy happens when someone relies <em>only<\/em> on emotions to persuade, without logic or facts. Example: \u201cYou <em>must<\/em> donate to my charity, or else innocent children will suffer!\u201d If there\u2019s no evidence of how the money helps, that\u2019s a fallacy\u2014emotional pressure without substance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Q6: How do you use pathos in a speech?<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>To use pathos effectively in a speech:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Tell a compelling story<\/strong> \u2013 Personal anecdotes or real-life examples work wonders.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Use vivid language<\/strong> \u2013 Metaphors, sensory details, and <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/writing-with-sensory-detail-engaging-all-five-senses\/\">powerful words create emotional impact<\/a>.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tap into shared emotions<\/strong> \u2013 Find common feelings your audience relates to (hope, frustration, nostalgia).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Balance it with ethos and logos<\/strong> \u2013 Emotion is great, but it\u2019s even stronger when backed by credibility and logic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Picture this: You\u2019re watching TV, minding your own business, when suddenly\u2014boom!\u2014Sarah McLachlan\u2019s Angel starts playing.
