But for years, traditional publishing has imposed restrictions on sci-fi writers, often preferring \u201csafe\u201d stories over bold, experimental ideas.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\u2019s why more authors than ever are turning to self-publishing. It offers creative freedom, faster publishing timelines, and higher earnings, allowing sci-fi writers to bring their visions to life without compromise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Full Creative Control Over Your Universe<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional publishers often prioritize market trends over originality, which can lead to story changes, editorial restrictions, or long waits for approval.
