Not only do we need to weave vivid scenes and <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/character-development\/\">develop complex characters<\/a>, but we also have to make sure we\u2019re &#8220;showing&#8221; the action instead of just &#8220;telling&#8221; it. Easy, right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, mastering the art of showing vs. telling can take your writing from flat and uninspiring to engaging and dynamic. Whether you\u2019re describing the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/story-outlining\/\">setting of your story<\/a> or the depth of your character\u2019s emotions, the right balance of showing can create a stronger connection with your readers and immerse them in your world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, we\u2019ll break down what &#8220;show, don\u2019t tell&#8221; really means, why it\u2019s crucial for great storytelling, and share 20 solid examples to help you take your writing to the next level. So, grab your pen (or keyboard) and let\u2019s dive into the world of &#8220;showing&#8221;\u2014no circus tricks required.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What Does &#8220;Show, Don&#8217;t Tell&#8221; Mean?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of those writing principles that sounds simple enough at first\u2014until you try to put it into practice. Essentially, it means painting a picture for your reader instead of just stating the facts. Instead of telling the reader that a character is sad, for example, you <em>show<\/em> the sadness through their actions, dialogue, or body language.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s an easy-to-understand example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling:<\/strong> <em>Sarah was nervous about the job interview.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing:<\/strong> <em>Sarah\u2019s hands trembled as she smoothed her skirt, her breath shallow as she glanced at the clock for the tenth time.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:14px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>See the difference? In the second example, we get a much clearer picture of Sarah\u2019s anxiety without being explicitly told. The reader can feel the tension through her actions, making the moment more relatable and vivid.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing invites the reader to draw their own conclusions, to feel the character\u2019s emotions in real time. Telling, on the other hand, simply informs without evoking much feeling. Think of showing as the movie version of your story and telling as the bullet points in a PowerPoint presentation. One paints a rich picture; the other\u2026well, not so much.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXcS2vdXAJ2BA2Ow93WawLiVmTGO8tXSUzY111eE3nKXjwbasUxXjOf8A-1esi2g6dPxkOZoeiXpkg36D8bmQc0_lnOQkz8SdKux_tEuFy2JgH_fJxB3sFAXQd_kFRn19SKLmufBtw?key=hmHz4Fg-UHQBnbsfIs_36J_q\" alt=\"A hyper-realistic image of two people in a cozy, well-lit room.

Soft natural light filters through a window, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere.\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key Differences Between Show and Tell<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve discussed the benefits of showing, let\u2019s explore the key differences between <em>showing<\/em> and <em>telling<\/em>. This is where things get interesting because understanding when to show and when to tell is essential for striking the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/balancing-plot-and-character-key-to-engaging-stories\/\">right balance in your writing<\/a>. Both techniques have their place, but knowing how to use them effectively can make or break a scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Show for Emotional Depth, Tell for Efficiency<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While showing creates emotional depth, telling is often more efficient. Sometimes, you don\u2019t need to delve deep into a character\u2019s emotions or the details of a setting. You just need to get to the point without slowing down the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/exploring-types-of-stories\/\">narrative<\/a>. Telling allows you to do that.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For instance:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling:<\/strong> <em>It was raining heavily.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing:<\/strong> <em>The rain pelted the windows like a thousand tiny drums, blurring the view and casting the world outside in a constant sheet of gray.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Both statements tell us it\u2019s raining, but the showing version paints a more vivid, sensory picture. However, if the rain isn\u2019t essential to the plot, it might be more effective to simply tell the reader it\u2019s raining and move on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When to Show: The Emotional or Dramatic Moments<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Show when you want to <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/10-narrative-techniques-to-create-tension-in-your-story\/\">create tension<\/a>, build suspense, or immerse readers in a significant emotional moment. These are the times when the emotional impact of showing can elevate the scene. Showing works wonders during moments of <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/the-7-types-of-conflict-in-literature\/\">conflict<\/a>, excitement, sadness, and joy\u2014anything that draws on the characters\u2019 emotional states.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling:<\/strong> <em>Mark was nervous about the speech.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing:<\/strong> <em>Mark stood at the podium, his hands slick with sweat. He swallowed hard, staring at the sea of faces, trying to remember what he was supposed to say next.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, showing makes us feel Mark\u2019s nerves, placing us right in his shoes. It gives us the sensory experience of his anxiety rather than just telling us he\u2019s nervous.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When to Tell: Unimportant or Background Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Tell when the details don\u2019t significantly affect the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/what-is-a-plot-a-beginners-guide\/\">plot<\/a> or the reader\u2019s emotional connection to the scene. Background information, transitions, and minor details often don\u2019t need to be shown. This helps you maintain pacing and keep the focus on more important elements of the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling:<\/strong> <em>It took them five hours to get to the city.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing:<\/strong> <em>Five long hours of bumping along the dirt road, with nothing but the occasional rustle of trees and the distant hum of the engine.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The showing example adds a little more texture, but if the travel time isn\u2019t crucial to the story, the telling version is likely more efficient.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Striking the Right Balance<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The key is balance. If every single moment in your story is shown, it can overwhelm the reader with detail and slow down the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/8-book-writing-pacing-techniques-to-keep-readers-hooked\/\">pacing<\/a>. On the other hand, too much telling can leave your readers feeling disconnected from the characters and the action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, you can blend both showing and telling in a way that works:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Example (Blended):<\/strong> <em>She looked out the window, her mind wandering, not caring that the rain had soaked her dress. It had been a long day. Too long. And she still had to face him.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Analysis:<\/strong> In this example, the first part shows her looking out the window, but the second part tells us she\u2019s exhausted, giving the reader a clear understanding of her state of mind without overloading them with unnecessary details.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The \u201cTelling Details\u201d Trap<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, when we think we\u2019re showing, we end up slipping into telling details that could be more vivid. Be cautious of phrases that subtly tell rather than show.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling Detail:<\/strong> <em>She was very scared.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing Detail:<\/strong> <em>Her breath came in sharp bursts, her pulse racing in her neck as she took one slow step toward the door, half-expecting it to swing open on its own.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The second example shows the physical reaction to fear, making it far more immersive and impactful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">20 Showing vs Telling Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered the differences between showing and telling, it&#8217;s time to dive into <em>real-life<\/em> examples. Here are 20 examples of show don&#8217;t tell that illustrate how you can transform flat, telling sentences into <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/world-building-in-fiction-writing-immersive-storylines\/\">immersive<\/a>, engaging moments that bring your story to life.

Sure, telling might seem easier in the moment\u2014after all, it\u2019s quicker to say \u201che was angry\u201d than to describe a clenched jaw, a reddening face, and fists that are practically vibrating with frustration. But here\u2019s the thing: showing is what makes your writing come alive. It\u2019s the difference between telling a joke and actually <em>performing<\/em> it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Creating Emotional Impact<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you show instead of tell, you allow your readers to <em>feel<\/em> the emotion instead of simply knowing about it. Think about a time you read something that made your heart race or brought a tear to your eye. Chances are, it wasn\u2019t just a character telling you how they felt\u2014it was their actions, their body language, the way they interacted with their environment that conveyed the emotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling:<\/strong> <em>John was terrified of the storm.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing:<\/strong> <em>John clutched the edge of his seat, his eyes wide as the thunder cracked, the room momentarily illuminated by lightning. He flinched at each gust of wind, as if expecting the house to collapse around him.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In the second example, you can almost feel John\u2019s fear without being explicitly told. The storm becomes a character in the scene, amplifying John\u2019s terror and pulling the reader into the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Making Characters More Real<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/writing-diverse-characters-representing-in-storytelling\/\">characters<\/a> show their emotions through actions, dialogue, and thoughts, they become multi-dimensional. Instead of being a set of traits and reactions, they start to feel like real people.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s compare:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Telling:<\/strong> <em>Emily was a hardworking person.<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Showing:<\/strong> <em>Emily didn\u2019t leave the office until the sky had darkened, her fingers stiff from typing but her eyes still glued to the screen. The pile of paperwork on her desk seemed to grow with each passing hour, but she didn\u2019t flinch. She just reached for her coffee and got back to work.<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>In this example, we understand Emily\u2019s work ethic without being explicitly told. The details\u2014her stiff fingers, the growing pile of work, the lack of hesitation\u2014paint a vivid picture of who Emily is. We get a deeper insight into her character, making her feel more real and relatable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Enhancing the Reading Experience<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Showing adds layers and depth to your writing. It turns simple sentences into immersive experiences. Readers feel like they\u2019re living the moment with the characters, rather than just being observers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, showing creates a much more dynamic and engaging experience for your audience. It turns passive reading into active participation. You\u2019re not just telling them the facts\u2014they\u2019re uncovering those facts themselves through your writing. And that\u2019s what makes storytelling truly magical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Common Mistakes When Showing vs Telling<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastering the art of showing vs telling isn\u2019t just about knowing when to show and when to tell\u2014it\u2019s also about avoiding common pitfalls that can make your writing feel forced or unclear. While it\u2019s easy to get excited about all the ways you can \u201cshow,\u201d it\u2019s also important to <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/balancing-plot-and-character-key-to-engaging-stories\/\">strike the right balance<\/a> and avoid overdoing it. Here are some common mistakes to watch out for:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Over-Showing (Too Much Detail)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s easy to get carried away with showing every single moment in your story. While showing can add richness and depth, too much of it can bog down your <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/story-writing-checklist\/\">narrative<\/a> and overwhelm the reader. You don\u2019t need to describe every single character movement or environmental detail\u2014focus on the key moments that need to resonate.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mistake Example:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>John sat in the chair, his back straight, his feet flat on the ground. His hands rested on the armrests, his fingers gripping the edges tightly. His chest rose and fell with each breath, and his gaze never wavered as he stared at the door, waiting for something, or someone, to enter.<\/em><em><br><\/em> This might be a bit much. Instead, focus on the key actions that convey his tension or focus.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better Version:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>John\u2019s gaze was fixed on the door, his hands gripping the chair\u2019s armrests, his breath shallow as he waited.<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>The second version cuts out unnecessary detail, honing in on what matters most: John&#8217;s tension.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Telling When You Should Be Showing<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It\u2019s tempting to tell when you\u2019re in a rush or simply unsure how to show an emotion or moment. However, telling can make your writing feel flat and uninspired, especially in moments that could benefit from being more immersive. When emotions or important actions are involved, try to show the experience, not just explain it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mistake Example:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>She was terrified of the dark.<\/em><em><br><\/em> You\u2019re missing an opportunity here to immerse the reader in her fear.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better Version:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>She froze at the edge of the hallway, her hand trembling on the light switch, but the darkness seemed to swallow the small beam of light from the hallway lamp, making her stomach churn with unease.<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This version puts the reader in the moment, allowing them to feel the terror rather than just reading about it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inconsistent Tone Between Showing and Telling<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another mistake occurs when the tone of your showing doesn\u2019t match the tone of the telling. In other words, if you\u2019re describing something with great emotional depth and detail but then throw in a line of telling that doesn\u2019t align with that tone, the balance can be off. Make sure your style stays consistent throughout your piece.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mistake Example (Inconsistent Tone):<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>He looked out the window, mesmerized by the storm. The wind howled, the rain battering the glass. He was scared of what might happen next.<\/em><em><br><\/em> The telling here seems blunt and doesn\u2019t match the intensity of the first two sentences.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better Version:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>He looked out the window, mesmerized by the storm. The wind howled, the rain battering the glass. His heart raced, as if the storm itself had a mind to tear everything apart.<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This keeps the tone consistent\u2014both showing and telling add to the mounting tension, keeping the emotion intact.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Overloading Readers with Too Many Telling Details<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, we tell too many details at once\u2014flooding the reader with information that they don&#8217;t need right away. Instead of dumping information in one big chunk, spread it out and use it strategically. If you want to tell something, choose a few impactful details rather than overwhelming the reader.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mistake Example:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>He was an angry man, always upset with everyone around him. His patience was nonexistent, and he hated people who were late. He didn\u2019t tolerate weakness in others, and he had a quick temper, which made him difficult to be around.<\/em><em><br><\/em> This is too much telling in one go and comes across as flat.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better Version:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>He slammed the door with a force that rattled the windows. The sound of his footsteps echoed down the hallway, each step a sharp reminder of his anger.<\/em><em><br><\/em> The showing here captures the essence of his anger without needing a laundry list of his flaws.<br><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Using Telling to Avoid Writing Scenes<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, writers turn to telling as a shortcut to avoid writing more detailed, difficult scenes. While it might seem easier to simply tell the reader what happened, skipping over important moments robs your story of depth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Mistake Example:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>They argued for hours, but in the end, they both agreed to compromise.<\/em><em><br><\/em> This is telling a pivotal moment of the story rather than showing the emotional conflict.<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Better Version:<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>They stood in silence, the air thick with unspoken words. Her arms crossed tightly, his hands clenched at his sides. After what felt like an eternity, he sighed and nodded, his voice barely above a whisper. \u201cI can\u2019t keep doing this.\u201d<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>By showing the emotional stakes and tension in this moment, you create a more engaging, compelling scene.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Avoid These Mistakes:<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Focus on Key Moments<\/strong>: Don\u2019t feel the need to show every single action or emotion. Pick the moments that are crucial to the story\u2019s emotional impact and bring those to life.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Balance Showing and Telling<\/strong>: Use telling for background information and when you need to keep the pace moving. Show when it will add depth and emotional connection.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keep the Tone Consistent<\/strong>: Ensure that your showing and telling match in tone, so the reader remains immersed in the scene.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Don\u2019t Skip Over Important Scenes<\/strong>: Showing isn\u2019t just about emotion\u2014it\u2019s about making your readers feel as though they\u2019re part of the story. Avoid telling to skip over the moments that matter.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Practice Show vs Tell<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Like anything in writing, mastering a technique comes with repetition and mindful effort. Fortunately, there are a few practical exercises you can do to sharpen your skills and make this technique second nature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rewrite Telling Sentences into Showing Sentences<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most effective ways to practice is to take sentences that simply tell and rewrite them in a way that shows the action or emotion. Here\u2019s how you can start:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Exercise:<\/strong> Take 5\u201310 sentences from your current work (or even from your favorite book or a random piece of writing), identify where the author is telling instead of showing, and try rewriting them to incorporate more sensory detail.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use the &#8220;Five Senses&#8221; Strategy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>When you want to show a scene, consider the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/writing-with-sensory-detail-engaging-all-five-senses\/\">sensory details<\/a>. What does the character see, hear, smell, feel, and taste? Using sensory descriptions makes your writing more immersive and helps the reader feel like they\u2019re <em>there<\/em> with the character. The key is to include only the most relevant senses to the moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Exercise:<\/strong> Describe a scene (setting, character, or action) using as many of the five senses as possible. Start with sight and sound, then consider how you can incorporate the other senses to enrich the scene.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Write a Scene with Only Showing (No Telling Allowed!)<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a particular emotional scene (like a character\u2019s heartbreak, excitement, or fear) and challenge yourself to write it using only showing. No \u201ctelling\u201d phrases allowed, such as \u201che was sad\u201d or \u201cshe felt nervous.\u201d Let the character\u2019s body language, dialogue, and actions convey the emotion.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Exercise:<\/strong> Write a scene where the character experiences a strong emotion, but <em>only<\/em> show it. Focus on physical reactions, inner thoughts, and subtle gestures to indicate how the character feels without directly telling the reader.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Analyze Your Favorite Books or Movies for Show vs Tell<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Take a moment to analyze scenes from your favorite books or movies and identify where showing vs telling is used effectively. Consider how the writer or filmmaker conveys emotion, tension, and setting without relying on direct explanations.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Exercise:<\/strong> Watch a scene from a movie or read a passage from a book and ask yourself, &#8220;How does the author or director <em>show<\/em> the emotions or actions? What clues do they give me to <em>feel<\/em> what the characters are experiencing?&#8221;<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>This exercise helps you analyze and internalize the techniques other successful storytellers use, giving you the tools to apply them to your own writing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Join a Writing Group or Workshop<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to improve your showing skills is to get feedback from others. Joining a writing group or workshop gives you a chance to share your work and receive constructive criticism. Other writers can point out where you might be telling rather than showing, and you can offer similar feedback to others in return.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Exercise:<\/strong> Share a piece of writing (or an excerpt) with your writing group or critique partner. Specifically ask them to look for areas where you can shift from telling to showing. Take their feedback into account and revise accordingly.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p>Group feedback provides fresh perspectives and can help you identify blind spots in your writing. Plus, it encourages you to keep experimenting with different approaches to showing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXdEYLgo8Rd48maafjguxeaT1w3m8qnIvOqXZ9wDCLaSx8ma19lwpLVRTqMVo3GgU47oxY5Hvf7KcM2NTd2LT6LOW3LI2vC_43P4fgon65V4TzV6GXciaS0-CpUhgRPYVsJUHs5OZQ?key=hmHz4Fg-UHQBnbsfIs_36J_q\" alt=\"A young adult person, dressed casually, is reaching for a colorful book on a shelf in a cozy library.

Scott Fitzgerald<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> <em>\u201cIn his blue gardens men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars.\u201d<\/em><em><br><\/em> <em>This description shows the carefree, almost ethereal atmosphere of Gatsby\u2019s parties without directly telling us how extravagant or fleeting they were.<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>&#8220;Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone&#8221; by J.K.

With practice, you\u2019ll elevate your writing, creating stronger connections with your readers and bringing your characters to life. Remember, it\u2019s all about balance. Use showing for emotional depth and vivid moments, but don\u2019t be afraid to tell when you need to keep the pace moving.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep practicing, seek feedback, and always stay curious about how other writers balance the two techniques. The more you write, the more natural showing will become, and soon it\u2019ll be your secret weapon for crafting unforgettable stories.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">FAQs &#8211; Show Don\u2019t Tell Examples<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q1: What is the golden rule of show don&#8217;t tell?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The golden rule is to convey emotions, actions, and settings through sensory details, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/dialogue-examples\/\">dialogue<\/a>, and character behaviors rather than explicitly stating them. Instead of telling the reader what a character is feeling, you show it by describing their reactions, body language, and environment. This engages the reader and allows them to experience the story more vividly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q2: How to show not tell excitement?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To show excitement, focus on physical reactions, fast-paced movements, and expressive dialogue. Describe the character\u2019s body language, tone of voice, and actions that convey energy and enthusiasm.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Example:<\/strong> Instead of saying, <em>\u201cShe was excited about the concert,\u201d<\/em> you could show it with, <em>\u201cHer feet bounced on the spot as she grabbed her coat, her eyes sparkling with anticipation.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q3: How to show not tell crying?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To show crying, describe the character\u2019s physical and emotional state. Focus on body language, facial expressions, and the impact the emotion has on their surroundings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Example:<\/strong> Instead of writing, <em>\u201cHe was crying,\u201d<\/em> you could show it with, <em>\u201cTears streaked down his face, his chest heaving with each sob as he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q4: What are examples of show and tell?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show and tell are techniques used in writing, and while showing brings scenes to life, telling serves to provide essential or background information. Here are examples:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Show:<\/strong> <em>\u201cHer hands trembled as she clutched the letter, her breath shallow as she read the words again.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Tell:<\/strong> <em>\u201cShe was nervous about the letter.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q5: How to show curiosity in writing?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Curiosity can be shown by describing a character&#8217;s focused actions, questioning tone, or their heightened awareness of their surroundings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Example:<\/strong> Instead of saying, <em>\u201cHe was curious about the old house,\u201d<\/em> you could show it with, <em>\u201cHe leaned forward, peering through the dusty window, his brow furrowed as he tried to make sense of the dark shape inside.\u201d<\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q6: What is an example of show not tell in film?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In film, showing instead of telling is achieved through visuals, acting, and cinematography. A great example is a character\u2019s facial expressions or body language during a tense moment.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Example:<\/strong> In <em>The Shawshank Redemption<\/em>, instead of telling us Andy is feeling hopeless, the camera lingers on his weary face, his posture slumped, and his eyes distant, conveying his despair without words.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:11px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q7: How to master show don&#8217;t tell?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastering &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; requires consistent practice and observation. Begin by identifying moments in your writing where you\u2019re telling and experiment with showing those emotions, actions, or descriptions. Use sensory details, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/metaphor-examples-in-literature\/\">metaphor,<\/a> and body language to convey feelings.
