Not only does this route\u00a0 allow authors to maintain more control over their work, it also allows them to receive a much higher percentage of the royalties from each sale of their book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the only way to ensure that your book had an audience was to get it published through a traditional publisher. However, innovations in production and distribution in the digital era have created new options for independent authors to self-publish and reach their own\u00a0 audience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-hard-is-it-to-get-a-book-published\/\">publishing a book may seem straightforward<\/a> for some, there\u2019s more to it than meets the eye. If you choose to go the self-publishing route, you\u2019ll have to spend time editing your manuscript, pay for marketing, not to mention the money it costs to hire any other publishing-related services you may need (such as cover designers, layout\/formatting professionals, and more).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/4-self-publishing-mistakes-that-self-publishing-companies-dont-want-to-see-you-make\/\">Self publishing companies<\/a> offer a more efficient and cost-effective option to help you on your publishing journey. In this article, you will learn the pros and cons of (1) self-publishing vs. traditional publishing, (2) self-publishing vs. vanity press, and (3) why you might\u00a0 consider <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/a-quick-guide-to-self-publishing-how-book-distribution-services-work-2\/\">working with a self publishing<\/a> company.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What are Self Publishing Companies?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We know what you\u2019re thinking. It\u2019s called \u201cself-publishing\u201d so why is a company involved? The truth is, self-publishing doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will do all the work, from writing and editing your manuscript to designing and <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-marketing\/\">marketing your book<\/a>. Despite the term, you still need other professionals to help you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, while you may be an excellent writer creating best-selling author material, it might not\u00a0 be realistic to think you have the time to implement a successful marketing campaign, or have the expertise to design your book cover. Self publishing companies often provide professional packages that include editing, book cover design, formatting, distribution, and more. For a fixed price, you&#8217;ll have the resources you need to publish your book, and the ability\u00a0 to promote it to a wider audience more easily.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self Publishing vs. Traditional Publishing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What is the difference between self publishing and <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Publishing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">traditional publishing<\/a>? When you submit your work to a traditional publishing house, you are literally selling them your book. They will pay for the printing, marketing, and distribution, and other miscellaneous expenses. In return, the publishing house will claim a more significant portion of the profit, ranging from 85 to 95 percent. This means you only get about a 5 to 15 percent share.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you publish through a self publishing company, you maintain full ownership of the book, however, you will be the one to pay for the publishing costs upfront.\u00a0 In return, you get a substantial percentage of royalties. At Spines, you can even get up to 70 percent royalties, one of the highest on the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Self-Publishing vs. Subsidy Publishing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subsidy Publishing is when authors pay a publishing house to publish their book, rather than relying on being chosen by one to get published. While some of these companies are reputable, many are not, and they are often overseen by sham organizations with names similar to legitimate publishers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Subsidy publishing houses are generally disreputable because they charge large amounts of money for their services but provide virtually zero marketing or editorial assistance. Under such an agreement, the author still has to do the marketing and promotion of their book with their own resources. Worse, it leaves them susceptible to costly production and distribution errors, which can be expensive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3 Benefits of Working with a Self Publishing Company<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Authors who prefer self publishing companies over traditional publishing companies do so because the self publishing companies allow the writer to completely control every aspect of the book. The self-publishing company will take care of most of the work for the author, such as editing, design, formatting, marketing, distribution, and promotion. In addition to having complete control of the publishing process, keeping ownership of your book, and getting up to 70 percent in royalties, there are many other benefits of publishing your book through a self publishing company.<\/span><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>They Are Quicker <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">&#8211; Traditional publishing companies are big, corporate, slow-moving beasts. They&#8217;re happy to take your manuscripts, put them on the back burner, forget about them, and return them when they&#8217;re tired of them. Some self-publishing platforms, like Spines, can publish your work within eight days, so you can hit the ground running with your book immediately.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Wide Distribution Network<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Self publishing companies are catching up to the big names in the publishing world. They might even have more channels to market on and a wider network of distributors because they are open to anyone who can pay, no matter how niche their genre.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Financial<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; Self publishing services typically provide authors with higher royalties than traditional publishers. Most self-publishing companies will handle typesetting, cover design, marketing, and distribution, and you\u2019ll get to enjoy a selection of superior services at a fraction of what it would cost if you were to hire different publishing service professionals independently. While one of the main benefits of working with a traditional publishing house is the financial advance that comes with the agreement, this may come at the price of your creative freedom. However, self-publishing companies (or the professional services you may hire when going this route) are not required to give you a refund if you are not satisfied with their results. Spines, however, offers a full 30-day money-back guarantee &#8211; and is <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">one of the only<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> self-publishing companies to do so.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether you are a veteran author or publishing your first book, self publishing is an excellent option to get your work out there. Self publishing companies offer authors more control over their book\u2019s production, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-cover-design\/\">book cover design<\/a>, and marketing than they might get if their book was published traditionally (not to mention, more royalties). <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>These days, more authors are choosing to work with self publishing companies.
