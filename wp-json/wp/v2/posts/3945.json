Getting your book in the hands of readers also requires thought about marketing to your target audience, and creating a physical product that promises what its content delivers. Although you may have already written a working title before you even finished your first chapter, it is worth taking a step back from your manuscript and considering the power your title has in selling your book &#8211; they are the first words anyone will read, and the words they will continuously repeat to their network if they liked the book enough to recommend it. In that sense, your title is more than a name, it is a slogan; short, striking, and punchy. So, put on your ad executive cap and let\u2019s talk about the 4 qualities of Best-Selling Book Titles.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>1. It\u2019s memorable.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First and foremost, if you want your book to be the talk of the town, nothing will spread like wildfire like a title that instantly gets stuck in your brain. There are several ways to accomplish this, but logistically speaking, a memorable title is one that is easy to repeat and understand. Use words that are easy to pronounce. Literary devices like alliteration (\u201cLove\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost,\u201d \u201cGone Girl,\u201d \u201cSense and Sensibility\u201d), idiom (\u201cOne Flew Over The Cuckoo\u2019s Nest,\u201d \u201cFinders Keepers,\u201d) and colloquialism ( \u201cThe Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck,\u201d \u201cWhat Happened To You?\u201d) roll off the tongue. The same goes with your consideration of using character\u2019s names in the title &#8211; if Harry Potter\u2019s name had actually been Harrisome Pottiferous, it would have been way harder to say, and therefore harder to remember. If you have written characters with difficult names to pronounce, consider simplifying them or not using them for the title altogether.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>2. It\u2019s short.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One word book titles have been trending, and it\u2019s not hard to see why &#8211; the right word can be a powerful worldbuilder. From classics like \u201c1984\u201d and \u201cDracula\u201d to new bestsellers \u201cVicious\u201d and \u201cCirce\u201d, an evocative name or word already jog the reader\u2019s brain to imagine other places and times. One word titles have the advantage of being mysterious; alluding to the reader that it is undoubtedly the central theme of the book without describing it. This leads the reader to inspect the <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">book cover<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-to-write-a-winning-book-description\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">book blurb<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for more clues, successfully drawing them in. Even if you can\u2019t narrow the title down to one word, shorter titles are best: The Author Learning Center recommends a title be <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.authorlearningcenter.com\/publishing\/preparation\/w\/choosing-a-title\/2214\/book-title-what-s-a-good-length---article\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5 words or less<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Statistically speaking, shorter titles tend to fare better in sales: case in point, last year\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/interactive\/2021\/11\/22\/books\/notable-books.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-books-general&amp;variant=show&amp;region=BELOW_MAIN_CONTENT&amp;block=storyline_flex_guide_recirc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York Times Bestseller list<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> averages between 2-5 words.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>3. It\u2019s evocative.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Shock, Inspiration, Arousal, Humor, Intrigue &#8211; these are powerful emotions that serve as tools for luring new readers. Titles that engage a reader emotionally have a strong chance of getting bought and read, and the more powerful the emotion, the more the reader\u2019s attention will be piqued. Let\u2019s browse some book titles that take us for a wild ride:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Shock:<\/i><\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cIt\u201d, \u201cHush, Hush\u201d, \u201cLick The Razor\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The shock value in these titles are from what images they provoke &#8211; or don\u2019t. The mystery of \u201cIt\u201d is in its vagueness &#8211; as if it is a thing so wretched, it\u2019s unnameable. \u201cHush, Hush\u201d makes you wonder what threat is listening and is a powerful mood setter. \u201cLick The Razor,\u201d can\u2019t help but make you feel dared to do something you probably wouldn\u2019t. These leave you wondering \u201cWhat?\u201d, \u201cWhy?\u201d and \u201cHow?\u201d in a tantalizing way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Inspiration: <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cYou Are A Badass\u201d, \u201cAwaken The Giant Within\u201d, \u201cThe Magic of Thinking Big\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Statements of confidence such as \u201cYou Are A Badass\u201d already give the reader permission to feel the way they want to feel &#8211; that\u2019s why they went in the self-help aisle in search of just that sort of book. Words like awaken, uncover, and release are also ways of commanding the audience\u2019s attention by empowering them to take meaningful action from within. Words like magic, sorcery, and miracle tap into the excitement of otherworldly endeavors.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Arousal:<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \u201cOpen Me\u201d, \u201cHate To Want You\u201d, \u201cLust\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hey now! The push and pull of seduction in \u201cHate To Want You\u201d, or the openly brazen and vulnerable \u201cOpen Me\u201d are playful, sexy and full of scintillating entendre. Even words like lust, passion, and climax are direct enough that the reader knows <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">exactly <\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what you\u2019re talking about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Humor: \u201c<\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are You There, Vodka? It\u2019s Me, Chelsea\u201d, \u201cBeauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever\u201d, \u201cI Am America (And So Can You!)\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether it\u2019s a play on culturally significant phrases, or intentionally incorrect grammar, humorous titles tend to use layers of cross-referencing and signaling to insinuate their book\u2019s point of view. By suggesting other art and media in your title, you make the reader feel witty by catching the reference. Implication is a clever way of bringing the reader in your inner circle, giving them the impression they\u2019re being spoken specifically to them.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b><i>Intrigue: <\/i><\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cWhere Did The Baby Go?\u201d \u201cCrying in H-Mart,\u201d \u201cHow Stella Got Her Groove Back,\u201d \u201cThe Time-Traveler\u2019s Wife\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to the who\/how\/why questions you\u2019re left with in titles that shock you, evoking that need to fill in the blanks works with the subtle details (and omissions!) of these title examples. How does no one know where a baby went? What causes someone to cry in a grocery store? Why did Stella lose her groove? What\u2019s it like being married to a time-traveler? Reading these titles, you can\u2019t help but brainstorm your own search for a baby, your own healing, your own perspective on long-distance love. You begin to formulate your own theories on the answers to these questions and predicaments &#8211; and the book becomes either a validation or discovery of those hypotheses. Either way, these titles stoke enough curiosity that the reader feels the need to dig into the world of the book to itch that scratch.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>4. It\u2019s original.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your story is inherently unique &#8211; so make sure your title leaves the same mark. Whether you have a distinct writing style, or the content is unusual, the title is the place to billboard those differences. Some authors take an innovative spin on this, and come up with their own words (\u201cBossypants,\u201d \u201cIsh\u201d, \u201cThe Pursuit of Happyness\u201d). On the flipside, be on the lookout for referencing other popular titles, authors, or trademarked terms in your own title. Besides the risk of having to lose in SEO competition with ubiquitous keywords, certain publishing companies like Amazon have strict guidelines against their usage.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-91695 size-medium\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/book-title-300x277.png\" alt=\"Best-Selling Book Titles\" width=\"300\" height=\"277\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/book-title-300x277.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/book-title-600x553.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/02\/book-title.png 706w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Best-Selling Book Titles &#8211; Final Points<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hopefully, you\u2019re able to come up with a title that has several (or all) of these qualities.
