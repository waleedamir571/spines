As a writer, you\u2019ll probably wonder if you should try a self-publishing service, or if you should consider going the traditional route instead.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After all, a publishing company will ensure you have a high-quality book that\u2019s distributed to the right places and marketed appropriately. While you can self-publish your books for less money, but with more control, you may end up with a book that looks and feels sub-par. What\u2019s more, likely, you don\u2019t have enough experience on how to distribute it properly.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines and Reedsy are among the many self-publishing platforms out there that help writers get the job done. This article gives you the rundown on who they are, what they offer, and if they might be the right choice for you.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Publishing With <strong>Reedsy<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reedsy is a service marketplace that provides tools to authors and publishers in the self-publishing industry. You can hire ghostwriters, editors, cover designers, and more with the platform. One of the key things that differentiates Reedsy from its competition is their ability to vet the freelancers\u2019 work experience and track record on their platform. Reedsy also makes collaboration more manageable through writing tools, automated contracts, and secure payments.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What the Reedsy Platform Offers<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In addition to connecting authors and publishers to talented professionals, Reedsy offers a wide range of tools that help authors and publishers regardless of where they are in their journey. Here are some of the services that they offer:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reedsy Book Editor<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The online book editor is a word processor specifically designed for authors, making it easier to export manuscripts to Mobi, ePub, or PDF.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reedsy Plot Generator<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This plot generator allows the writer to choose a genre, and it will generate ideas for the plot, plot twist, protagonist, and secondary character.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reedsy Discovery<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Discovery uses a format similar to Goodreads, where self-published books can get discovered by reviewers before authors formally launch them. Reviewers are paid on a tip basis from readers of the reviews, and authors gain credibility from the review.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Reedsy Marketplace<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Reedsy Marketplace is where publishers and authors can browse through expert editors, cover designers, web designers, and ghostwriters, among others, to help them publish their books. Reedsy takes a 10% cut from the freelancer and another 10% from the author for this service.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Educational Content<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reedsy also provides free educational courses to writers no matter what stage they are at in their journey. You\u2019ll find series on topics like self-publishing, Facebook ads, book marketing, and even Amazon algorithms.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Publishing With Spines<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines gives authors a way to publish their works in a convenient and cost-efficient manner. As a veteran AI-powered <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/about\/\">publishing platform<\/a>, Spines has publishing connections worldwide, making it easy to distribute books easily. The company works with new authors, established authors, and self-publishers, with manuscripts on hand and ready to be published.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because Spines uses <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Artificial_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AI technology<\/a> for manuscript proofreading and formatting, the company can cut processing time to just around a month, unlike traditional publishers that take months to finish the job.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Tools and Services<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines provides all of the services that authors need during the publishing process, from manuscript proofreading, cover design, formatting, and distribution. Specifically, Spines offers the following:<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Manuscript Proofreading<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines&#8217; state-of-the-art AI proofreading tools perform a thorough analysis of the manuscript. If you\u2019ve purchased their basic plan (under $3000 from manuscript to book-in-hand) AI suggestions are sent straight to the author for final approval. If you\u2019ve purchased Spines&#8217; standard or premium plans, you get \u201chybrid\u201d proofreading; essentially two passes, one done by AI, and a second revision by a Spines staff proofreader. In either case, the author is sent highlighted changes once proofreading is completed, giving the writer complete creative control of what to do next.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Cover Design<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines has expert in-house cover designers with a rich image database to help authors select the best image for their book. If the author already has an existing cover, production managers will review it and give their suggestions, if desired.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Formatting<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The book\u2019s formatting and design is a collaboration between the author and Spines \u2013 with the author having the final say in how their book is presented. AI is used to design the book, but humans still manually check and confirm edits to the end product.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Distribution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The published book can reach a global audience in a matter of days, distributing your work across 100+ channels including BAM, Books Express, Baker &amp; Taylor, Amazon, and Barnes &amp; Noble. Spines also handles distribution through a monthly subscription service, giving you plenty of options to suit your price point. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instead of having to pay total distribution costs upfront, Spines has worldwide distribution packages lasting anywhere from 1-5 years, at only $20-39\/month. This will ensure your book will be available long term, at an affordable rate &#8211; and the longer you want your book on shelves, the cheaper the monthly subscription cost.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Print on Demand &amp; eBook<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since it\u2019s not always an author\u2019s desire to release their book for physical distribution, Spines offers print on demand and eBook as their default on all package tiers. This prevents unwanted costs of printing for smaller publishing projects and allows authors to manage each publishing project according to their distribution needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Spines vs Reedsy: Which Should You Choose?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choosing between Reedsy and Spines depends on your needs, as well as your general comfort level and experience with the publishing process.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With great power comes great responsibility \u2013 If you are looking for more creative control (down to hiring your proofreader, designer, and any other specialists necessary to complete your publishing), then Reedsy may be a good choice for you. In addition to the amount you\u2019ll spend for each publishing professional you hire from the Reedsy marketplace, you\u2019ll also have to pay 10% to Reedsy for every sale of your book.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other hand, Spines is an all-in-one AI-powered publishing company that helps authors get their works published in print-on-demand and eBook formats after around a month. If you are looking for someone with the expertise to take you from start to finish of the publishing process, Spines may be for you. The company can take your book to completion (including a year of distribution) for under $3000 with their basic plan.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><strong>Disclaimer: All information is provided for reference only and may change without notice.
