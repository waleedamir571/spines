Step away for at least a few hours (ideally overnight). Distance gives you fresh eyes, so you spot mistakes and awkward phrasing you\u2019d miss if you dive in immediately.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 2: Revisit Your Purpose and Audience<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself: <em>Who am I writing for?<\/em> and <em>What\u2019s the key takeaway?<\/em> Re-read your headline, intro, and conclusion. Do they align with that purpose? If not, rewrite your intro to set the right promise and adjust the ending so it ties everything back to the reader\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 3: Check Overall Structure<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look at your piece like a skeleton. Do the ideas flow logically from one section to the next? Create a quick outline of your H2s\/H3s and see if the order makes sense. Reorganize sections that feel out of place and cut anything that doesn\u2019t serve your main point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 4: Strengthen Paragraphs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go through your piece paragraph by paragraph. Each paragraph should make <em>one<\/em> clear point, starting with a strong opening sentence. Break up long walls of text into shorter chunks, and add transitions to guide the reader (e.g., \u201cFor example,\u201d \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d \u201cNext\u201d).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 5: Sharpen Sentences<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read every sentence aloud. If you can\u2019t say it in one breath, it\u2019s probably too long. Split run-ons into shorter sentences. Replace weak verbs (\u201cis,\u201d \u201cmake,\u201d \u201cdo\u201d) with stronger alternatives (\u201cbecomes,\u201d \u201ccreate,\u201d \u201cachieve\u201d). For example:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Weak: <em>She made a decision to start writing.<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Strong: <em>She decided to start writing.<\/em><em><br><\/em><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:13px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 6: Improve Word Choice and Tone<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cut filler words like <em>just, very, really, that<\/em>. Replace vague phrasing with concrete detail. Make sure your tone matches your audience\u2014casual for blogs, formal for research, inspirational for thought leadership. Keep terms consistent throughout (don\u2019t switch between \u201cclients\u201d and \u201ccustomers\u201d unless intentional).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 7: Focus on Clarity and Readability<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask: <em>Would someone new to this topic understand?<\/em> Use short sentences, simple words, and active voice. If a sentence sounds complicated, rewrite it. Tools like Hemingway App can highlight hard-to-read passages.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 8: Apply the CUPS\/COPS Method (Mechanics)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do a focused line-edit using one of these checklists:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>CUPS<\/strong> \u2192 Capitalization, Usage (grammar), Punctuation, Spelling<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>COPS<\/strong> \u2192 Capitalization, Organization, Punctuation, Spelling<br>This helps you catch mechanical errors quickly and ensures consistency across your work.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:9px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 9: Format for Scanability<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most readers skim first. Use clear headings, bullet points (sparingly), bolding for key terms, and consistent spacing. Break long sections with visuals, quotes, or callouts. Check formatting on both desktop and mobile\u2014especially if publishing online.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Step 10: Final Review: Peer + Tools<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do a last read-through with text-to-speech or by reading aloud. Then, if possible, hand it to a peer with a peer editing checklist (ask them: <em>Is the main point clear? Where do you get lost?<\/em>). Finally, run a grammar checker like Grammarly or ProWritingAid\u2014but don\u2019t blindly accept suggestions. Trust your voice<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Peer Editing Checklist<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Use this checklist to edit your a peers work:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Before You Begin<\/strong><strong><br><\/strong> \u2610 Read the entire piece once without stopping.
