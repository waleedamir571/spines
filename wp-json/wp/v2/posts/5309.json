Please check out our other articles in our comparison series, where we do side-by-side comparisons of Spines and other top self-publishing companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/spines-vs-bookbaby-who-should-you-publish-with\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bookbaby<\/a> and <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/spines-vs-kdp-which-option-is-right-for-you\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kindle Direct Publishing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the digital age of self-publishing, there are many steps authors have to take on between finishing the final draft of their manuscript and sending your book out for distribution. Editing, proofreading, and the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/should-you-design-your-own-book-cover-why-a-pro-is-the-way-to-go\/\">design and formatting of the cover and interior of your book<\/a> are all essential steps to the production process &#8211; but they are typically aspects to book production that the author then delegates to literary and design professionals.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Thankfully, in the ever-growing self-publishing industry, several companies offer packages that include editing and design services. As an author, it can be daunting to find the right service for your needs &#8211; for instance, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/5-proven-steps-in-the-writing-process\/\">Spines is a one-stop shop for all steps in the publishing process<\/a>, while Scribe is an editorial and production service that gets your digital manuscript ready for distribution. Let\u2019s compare the two companies so that you can figure out which may best serve your publishing needs.<\/span> <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pricing Comparison <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines offers more options in terms of publishing packages, and the price is overall lower in comparison to Scribe Media\u2019s options, which start in the low five figures. This is because the services that Spines provide are differently tiered than with Scribe. <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/landing-page\/\">Spines<\/a> offers a low-tier, DIY package where Spines handles ISBN, metadata, and distribution. For authors who have hired their own editing and design team, this is a very competitively priced bundle that allows your book to be distributed on dozens of platforms and printed on demand for under $3000.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Spines Pricing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"628\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-1024x628.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-329302\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-1024x628.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-300x184.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-768x471.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-1536x942.png 1536w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-360x221.png 360w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1-600x368.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.46.24-1.png 2036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scribe Media Pricing<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"491\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-1024x491.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-329303\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-1024x491.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-300x144.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-768x369.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-1536x737.png 1536w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-360x173.png 360w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58-600x288.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/Screenshot-2025-10-24-at-14.52.58.png 1688w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scribe Media\u2019s main publishing package, which starts at $29,000 includes editing and proofreading, book design, the IBSN\/metadata and distribution &#8211; the same promises Spines makes in their lowest tier package. If you are an independent or first time author, dropping the kind of money Scribe\u2019s services ask for might be unrealistic for your budget. <\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, why are Scribe\u2019s prices <\/span><b>so much more than<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that of Spines?&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of Scribe<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The key distinction is that Scribe is specifically designed for professionals, including entrepreneurs, consultants, and executives. In contrast, Spines caters to a diverse range of authors, offering flexible packages that accommodate both seasoned professionals and first-time or aspiring authors, ensuring accessibility and support for all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s look at Scribe&#8217;s previous published books. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hundreds of their books have been world best-sellers, and it is no coincidence &#8211; they have a team of experienced designers crafting an artful cover for your book that is sure to compete in retail. Bestselling book covers crafted by Scribe\u2019s design team include <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Can\u2019t Hurt Me<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zero to One<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Are You There, Vodka? It\u2019s Me, Chelsea<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">; and <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Choose Yourself<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, among others.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scribe\u2019s edit and proofreading include line-editing.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s important to have an editor who can make sure your work is cohesive, clear and readable on a technical level. In addition, Scribe specifically includes line editing in their packages, which focuses on the content, style and language of your manuscript. Much like having an experienced designer working on your book cover, a line editor will have an eye for what meets the industry standard in tone, and will be able to offer a more in-depth examination of your manuscript with suggestions on how to improve your writing voice &#8211; kind of like having a professional assessment with a writing coach.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scribe has a devoted marketing team that will handle social media posts, email marketing, schedule interviews for you, and more.<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scribe marketing services include more than just advertisements &#8211; they are willing to be your publicist, marketing strategist and business manager for a month after your book drops. These services easily cost thousands of dollars on their own, so it makes sense that their inclusion in Scribe\u2019s package would contribute to Scribe\u2019s hefty pricing.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Advantages of Spines<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though it may be tempting to put all your faith (and money) in a company like Scribe Media, here are some advantages to publishing your book with Spines<\/span>. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Scribe\u2019s platform takes at least 6 months to get your <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/about\/\">book in stores, Spines promises excellent customer service, working to get your book published<\/a> in just over a month. This is partially possible because of Spines&#8217; revolutionary, AI-powered editing and design, which greatly reduces labor and production costs.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\u2019t have to pay for print costs or a royalty buyout upfront. <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned before, part of the reason why Scribe is so expensive is because they make the assumption that you\u2019ll want at least 100 physical softcover books, and that your sales will warrant a significant revenue. Spines offers digital only, print on demand options that ensure that even if you were to print 100 books, you would still only need to pay a fraction of the cost, and for those who are only creating a digital version of their book, that cost is omitted entirely.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Paying upfront for printing can be wishful thinking, and if you\u2019re a first time author, \u201cpay as you go\u201d print on demand can end up saving you a lot of money. As for royalties, you would need to <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/selling-books-online-self-promotion-strategies-that-work\/\">sell nearly 10,000 books<\/a> to make back your upfront costs with Scribe. With Spines, you are guaranteed to make back your money within as little as your first 100 book sales. If you\u2019re only doing digital book sales, that number decreases even further.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Between having a personal production manager, to managing distribution, Spines offers competitive pricing across the board for all of its services. Using AI technology as well as a devoted in-house team ensures they are able to get your book ready to print faster and cheaper than ever before.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It\u2019s reasonable to expect that you shouldn\u2019t have to take out a loan in order to get published. It\u2019s important for publishing to be affordable, because it helps even the playing field for authors who might not have the means, otherwise.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Scribe vs Spines<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scribe Media\u2019s initial costs are insurance that the books they publish not only meet industry standard, but their own, as well &#8211; they become a full-service, on demand publishing house. However, it may suit your own creative process and style to find your own team for elements like design, literary editing, or marketing &#8211; in which case, the packages offered by Spines make more sense. However you choose to continue your self-publishing journey, we are lucky to have a myriad of options at our disposal, and hopefully, one that suits your goals as an author.<\/span><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h6 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\"><span data-teams=\"true\"><strong>Disclaimer: All information is provided for reference only and may change without notice.
