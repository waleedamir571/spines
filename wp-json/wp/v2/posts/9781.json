Books are greater than the sum of their parts; more than sentences and pages, they are other worlds that help us make sense of our own. Reading has an indelible impact on a person\u2019s life, and the books that are cherished are often passed down through generations. Your writing has the opportunity to expand your reach and impact on others, several lifetimes over. By writing a <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/about\/\">book and publishing<\/a> it, you are creating something that will last for a very long time.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Writing is healing.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many authors testify that they began to write in times of strife. In times of crisis, sometimes people don\u2019t have others to turn to, so they seek answers, insight, and relief from their own words. Getting your feelings off your chest and onto paper is an effective outlet for processing difficult events and circumstances. It is also comforting to note that while many stories have been born out of pain, they have given their readers pure moments of joy.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Sharing is caring.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing can be an effective tool for healing. However, reading can also heal! Sharing hardship in writing can be therapeutic for both the author and the reader, giving the writer catharsis while also helping give others who may have had similar experiences a chance to be deeply seen and understood. Your words have the power to inspire, give hope, and remind others that they are not alone.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Writing is meditation.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation isn\u2019t necessarily just sitting on the floor, closing your eyes, and practicing breathing. You can find your inner zen through writing, as well. The purpose of meditation is to focus on the present, release emotions and thoughts you tend to hold on to and cultivate more peace of mind. Putting your full concentration on writing whatever comes to mind may actually help those who struggle with <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Meditation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">meditation<\/a>. There are fantastic ideas that can come out of free-form writing &#8211; some that can even be turned into a book!\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Your perspective and experience has value.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not everyone has the opportunity to develop a relationship with a mentor as they navigate their lives, career and relationships. There is an ever burgeoning industry of self-help books that aim to enlighten, offer you perspective, and grant you the wisdom that a mentor would bestow. Have you developed a method for dealing with anxiety? Do you have solid tips for investing in real estate? Have you gone on an intense spiritual journey towards enlightenment? Don\u2019t underestimate the value of your life experience; the things you have learned could be very useful to a lot of people.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10317\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2-600x338.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/2.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><b>Real stories inform the world.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">People who go through life-changing experiences and extraordinary events often have rare insight into the world. Some stories are instructive and raise awareness of certain issues that are not currently part of a larger conversation, yet. Your story could trailblaze an entire movement, giving the issue more attention, and the opportunity for more people to research and fund a resolution. Real stories stir the emotions of the masses, and your story could be an important and very needed call to action.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>\u201cPublished Author\u201d is a coveted title.<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is no coincidence that many professionals and celebrities publish books.
