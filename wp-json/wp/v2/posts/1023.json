In just the past few years, many <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">authors have been able to produce professional-quality, competitive books at a fraction of the cost. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With self-publishing continuing to grow at a rate of 40% in 2018 according to Proquest affiliate Bowker, it\u2019s clear that the publishing industry is in transition.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking to become a published author yourself, Spines vs SelfPublishing.com, these are just two of the many self-publishing platforms out there to consider. They offer a variety of services and benefits, though some may suit your needs better than others. This article compares the two platforms to help you decide which one might be the better choice for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Spines vs selfpublishing.com<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/about\/\">Spines is a publishing platfrom<\/a> established in 2013, offering publishing-related services such as editing, proofreading, layout, bookbinding, illustration, design, printing, online distribution, and more. Their mission is to be a one-stop shop, so authors don\u2019t have to go anywhere else to obtain the publishing services they need. Spines offers its services in bundles: (1) Distribution and (2) Print-on-demand and eBook.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3>Basic Yearly Plan<\/h3>\n<p>For authors who either have a book ready to go or just need a final touch-up on their design and manuscript Spines offers a basic plan that covers the bases from production ([db_wc_production_price id=&#8221;6852&#8243;]) to distribution (monthly subscription starting at $20\/month):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic cover design<\/li>\n<li>AI-based proofreading<\/li>\n<li>Formatting<\/li>\n<li>Print-on-demand<\/li>\n<li>eBook<\/li>\n<li>ISBN x2<\/li>\n<li>Metadata optimization<\/li>\n<li>100+ distribution channels<\/li>\n<li>Dedicated production manager<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We\u2019ll break this down in more detail:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>ISBN<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Because the Spines Distribution Bundle comes with two ISBNs, you can have your print-on-demand book and the eBook ready to go. Because ISBNs are unique identifiers, you\u2019ll need them for every book format and edition. Currently, buying a single ISBN from Bowker, (the official US agency providing these numbers) costs $125. These numbers are cheaper in bulk, but unless you plan on <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-hard-is-it-to-get-a-book-published\/\">publishing multiple books<\/a> in one go, you may not need to buy that many.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Book metadata optimization<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As part of the Distribution Bundle, Spines will take care of your metadata to make your book more visible across platforms like Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, library catalogs, bookstores, and more. Metadata includes your title, subtitle, genre, subgenre, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-to-write-a-winning-book-description\/\">book descriptions<\/a>, author bios, category codes (i.e., BISAC), book cover image, price, and target market.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>100+ distribution channels<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spines has an impressive distribution network that includes Amazon, Barnes &amp; Noble, Books-A-Million, Adlibris, and Bookazine to name a few. Many <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/4-self-publishing-mistakes-that-self-publishing-companies-dont-want-to-see-you-make\/\">self-published authors make a common mistake:<\/a> selling only through Amazon, which means you risk not reaching other potential readers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><strong>Print-on-demand &amp; eBook Bundle<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>With packages starting at [db_wc_production_price id=&#8221;6852&#8243;], Spines&#8217; production bundle helps authors with everything from proofreading to printing: (1) basic cover design, (2) proofreading, (3) formatting, (4) two ISBNs, (5) print-on-demand printing, and (6) eBook conversion.<\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Proofreading and Formatting<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you submit your manuscript, Spines will give proofreading and formatting suggestions. It will be run through their <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AI proofreading tools to perform a thorough analysis of the manuscript.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Afterward, their editing team will have a second review of the manuscript to make suggestions. You <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">are in full creative control, and can always decide what to accept or reject when it comes to your content and formatting.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h4><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basic Cover Design<\/span><\/h4>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Book covers are critical, and they can make or break a sale. Spines helps you figure out the design elements that suit your book and will help it sell the most. Most professional book cover designs have fees ranging from $250 to $500, depending on design complexity. This bundle can be a way to save money on production costs, as well as time spent looking for a designer independently.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>SelfPublishing.com<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SelfPublishing.com is a school for people looking to write, market, and publish their own books.

In contrast, Spines is a publishing platform with self-publishing services like editing, proofreading, formatting, distribution, and more.<br \/>\nYou will need to pay a one-time membership fee to receive training for a SelfPublishing.com course, while Spines will require you to purchase a package for your desired bundled services.

If it is important for you to gain the knowledge to embark on the publishing process on your own, SelfPublishing.com may be for you.
