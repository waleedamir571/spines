Short, character-driven stories like The Rosie Project, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry, or Before the Coffee Gets Cold are great starting points. They\u2019re easy to follow, emotionally satisfying, and help you rebuild the habit without feeling overwhelmed.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1764465162235\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \">Q: What are the best books to read of all time?<\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Lists vary, but certain titles come up again and again: To Kill a Mockingbird, 1984, Pride and Prejudice, Beloved, The Great Gatsby, and The Diary of a Young Girl. These books are considered some of the best books of all time because they\u2019ve stayed meaningful across generations.

If you\u2019re tired, pick something short and warm; if you want escape, choose fantasy or a gripping thriller. Using mood, genre, and length as quick filters makes choosing your next book to read much less overwhelming.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1764465177551\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: How many books should I aim to read in a year?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>There\u2019s no \u201ccorrect\u201d number\u2014it depends on your schedule, energy, and reading speed.
