This saves them some time in writing the second draft. For instance, in the context of novel writers, this includes crafting the premise, developing the characters, and constructing a timeline of the events. While outlining may take months, it can make the <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/5-proven-steps-in-the-writing-process\/\">writing process<\/a> fairly easier and quicker. The following image highlights the main elements of outlining:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-3814 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/outlining.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"512\" height=\"323\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/outlining.png 512w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/outlining-300x189.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Grisham, a popular American novelist, states,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u201cThe more time I spend on the outline, the easier the book is to write. And if I cheat on the outline, I get in trouble with the book.\u201d Using this strategy, Grisham has been able to pen 40 novels since the 1980s, with\u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.celebritynetworth.com\/richest-celebrities\/authors\/john-grisham-net-worth\/#:~:text=During%20his%20career%2C%20John%20Grisham,having%20sold%20300%20million%20copies.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">300+ million<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0copies sold and 28 consecutive best sellers.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A pantser,<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">on the contrary, is a writer who lets the spark of their idea fly them in whichever direction it wishes to take them \u2013 as if to \u201c<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">fly by the seat of their pants\u201d (hence, the name <\/span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pants<\/span><\/i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">er). <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In other<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">words, they don\u2019t plan or make an outline of their book\u2019s structure. Such writers are open to rewriting their drafts every time a new idea inspires them. A lot of rewriting means a greater investment of time.\u00a0Some of the pantsers<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">may enjoy writing at a slow pace because they like every writing session to feel inspiring and moving. Waiting for that inspiration to hit them might lead to writer\u2019s block, and potentially a loss of narrative cohesion, resulting in a stretch of the writing duration.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Write a Book Faster: How Consistent Are You When You?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b><br \/>\n<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While different writing methods play an important role in determining how long it could take to write a book, an even more important factor is consistency. A pantser who dedicates an hour or so to their writing every single day is likely to take less time than a planner who plans and writes inconsistently. The allocation of time, and the dedication to write a set number of words every day<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">,<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> play a significant role in the quick and timely completion of a book.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">John Grisham and Stephen King are two fiction authors who employ different writing techniques but are both very prolific. Grisham is a plotter, whereas King is a pantser. What makes both of them similar (and evidently, successful), is that both write, at least, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cheatsheet.com\/entertainment\/stephen-king-and-john-grisham-disagree-on-how-to-write-books.html\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1,000 words<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0for their respective books each day. With this consistency, King has been able to <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-hard-is-it-to-get-a-book-published\/\">publish two books<\/a> per year.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Do the Same Standards Apply to a Non-fiction Book?<\/b><b><\/b><\/h2>\n<p><b><br \/>\n<\/b><b><\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing a non-fiction book is a completely different process than crafting a narrative, and the factors that can influence writing duration differ as well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One main consideration is<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">the technical complexity of the book. While small autobiographies may take an average of 3 months, research-extensive books can take up to 3 to 5 years. This is because qualitative methods, like scheduling interviews, depend entirely on the availability of the interviewees, which varies greatly. This data has to then be filtered and sorted under different chapter headings, which is a step that isn\u2019t involved in fiction writing &#8211; making the determination of the time required to write a non-fiction book completely incomparable.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is evident that there are no set criteria to determine how long it takes to write a book \u2013 and that the key is consistency and determination.<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there are no research constraints, you should expect to write a minimum of 300 words and a maximum of 5,000 words per day (anything exceeding 1,000 words a day is a reasonable estimate). To start, you can use this range to set a daily goal for yourself, and then calculate the estimated total writing time of your book. For instance, if the planned length of your book is 100,000 words, you should expect to spend around 100 days writing it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the exact time depends on various factors, what matters most is for you to take the first step and start writing. Once you do, you\u2019ll figure out the method that works best for you and helps you stay focused and keeps your timeline realistic \u2013 without compromising the quality of the script.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Are you planning to write a book and wondering how long it might actually take?
