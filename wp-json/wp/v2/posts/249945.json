Is it the magic? The drama? Or maybe it\u2019s the wicked satisfaction of seeing villains get what\u2019s coming to them (or not, if you&#8217;re feeling generous). Whatever the reason, these stories have enchanted us for centuries, proving that a glass slipper, a poisoned apple, or a magic lamp never truly goes out of style.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the thing: \u201cold fairy tales\u201d don\u2019t have to stay old. The best part of writing fairy tale retellings is breathing new life into those &#8220;classic fairy tales&#8221; we all know and love. Whether you\u2019re setting &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; in a &#8220;modern setting,&#8221; telling &#8220;Sleeping Beauty&#8221; from the &#8220;wicked witch\u2019s perspective,&#8221; or reimagining &#8220;Red Riding Hood&#8221; in space (<em>because why not?<\/em>), there\u2019s endless potential to give a &#8220;unique new spin&#8221; to these timeless tales.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This article is your enchanted map, guiding you through the steps to craft a &#8220;great fairy tale retelling&#8221; that blends &#8220;source material&#8221; with fresh creativity. From picking the perfect story idea to polishing your draft and getting published, you\u2019re about to embark on an exciting creative journey. So, grab your pen (or wand) and get ready to write your &#8220;own story.&#8221; After all, who says the &#8220;fairy godmother&#8221; gets to have all the fun?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Magic Begins: Choosing Your Tale<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every &#8220;great fairy tale retelling&#8221; starts with a question: <em>Which tale is calling your name?<\/em> With so many &#8220;classic fairy tales&#8221; out there, the possibilities are as endless as Rapunzel\u2019s hair. Whether it\u2019s &#8220;The Little Mermaid&#8221; swimming through your mind, &#8220;Sleeping Beauty&#8221; whispering from her slumber, or &#8220;Snow White&#8221; and her seven quirky roommates catching your eye, the key is to pick a particular fairy tale that resonates with you on a personal level. After all, if you\u2019re not enchanted by the story, how can you expect your readers to be?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen your tale, it\u2019s time to work some creative magic. Ask yourself: Is there an &#8220;untapped angle&#8221; waiting to be explored? Maybe it\u2019s the &#8220;not-so-evil queen&#8221; struggling with her bad PR, or the overlooked &#8220;fairy godmother&#8221; juggling her wand and a midlife crisis. By shining a spotlight on &#8220;minor characters&#8221; or asking <em>what if?<\/em> questions, you can transform the &#8220;same story&#8221; into something fresh and exciting.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For inspiration, look to &#8220;popular fairy tale retellings&#8221; like <em><a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_Lunar_Chronicles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Lunar Chronicles<\/a>,<\/em> where Cinderella becomes a cyborg, or <em>Wicked,<\/em> which reimagines the &#8220;wicked witch&#8221; of Oz. These stories show how a &#8220;unique spin&#8221; can turn popular fairy tale retellings into something extraordinary.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, don\u2019t forget to check the &#8220;public domain&#8221; status of your chosen tale. While &#8220;old fairy tales&#8221; like &#8220;Cinderella&#8221; or &#8220;Red Riding Hood&#8221; are fair game, more recent works (<em>looking at you, Disney<\/em>) may come with strings attached. So, pick your &#8220;source material&#8221; wisely, and you\u2019ll be ready to craft a retelling that\u2019s as timeless as it is original!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Plot Twist: Crafting a Unique Spin<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you\u2019ve chosen your &#8220;original fairy tale.&#8221; Now comes the fun part: giving it a &#8220;unique spin&#8221; that transforms the &#8220;same story&#8221; into something entirely your own. The trick is to maintain a &#8220;firm grasp&#8221; on the heart of the &#8220;original tale&#8221; while introducing enough fresh ideas to make it stand out. After all, the goal isn\u2019t to rewrite <em>Cinderella<\/em> word-for-word\u2014it\u2019s to reimagine her journey in a way only <em>you<\/em> can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>New Genre, New Magic<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One surefire way to breathe life into &#8220;old fairy tales&#8221; is to place them in a &#8220;new genre.&#8221; What if <em>Sleeping Beauty<\/em> became a &#8220;sci-fi&#8221; thriller set on a starship? Or did <em>Red Riding Hood<\/em> become a dystopian saga where the Big Bad Wolf is a corrupt corporation? Moving the &#8220;original story&#8221; into unfamiliar territory can create endless creative possibilities while still nodding to the familiar.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who&#8217;s Telling the Story?<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great way to create a &#8220;unique fairy tale retelling&#8221; is to flip the perspective. Ever wondered what the &#8220;wicked witch&#8221; or the &#8220;fairy godmother&#8221; might have to say? Retelling from a &#8220;villain\u2019s perspective&#8221; or focusing on one story or a &#8220;side character&#8221; like the prince\u2019s overlooked best friend can completely reshape the narrative. A &#8220;not-so-evil queen&#8221; battling palace politics, anyone?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Themes That Speak to Today<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to make your retelling feel fresh and relevant? Add themes that resonate with modern readers. Blend &#8220;self-discovery&#8221; arcs, &#8220;romantic relationships,&#8221; or even tackle deeper issues like social inequality or climate change. Think of a &#8220;Cinderella retelling&#8221; set in a &#8220;modern setting&#8221; where the glass slipper is a job application, and you\u2019re already halfway to a bestseller.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Balancing Creativity with Tradition<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While your creative license and freedom is your best friend, don\u2019t abandon your readers\u2019 favorite &#8220;plot points&#8221; completely. Whether it\u2019s the poisoned apple, the ball, or the iconic red cape, these little nods to the &#8220;source material&#8221; act as breadcrumbs to guide your audience through your &#8220;new story.&#8221; The key is to mix familiarity with surprise, so readers think, <em>I know this story\u2014but I\u2019ve never seen it like this before.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a dash of creativity and a sprinkle of magic, your retelling can go from an &#8220;old fairy tale&#8221; to a &#8220;great example&#8221; of innovative storytelling. So, grab that wand (or keyboard), and let the twisty plotting begin!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Building the World: Setting the Stage<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every &#8220;great fairy tale retelling&#8221; needs a world that feels as enchanting as the tale itself. Whether you\u2019re crafting a sprawling &#8220;fantasy novel,&#8221; a sleek &#8220;sci-fi&#8221; epic, or something entirely unexpected, the setting should immerse readers in your original story, and make them believe in its magic. The secret? Blending the essence of the &#8220;original story&#8221; with fresh, imaginative details that create something entirely new.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>Fantasy, Sci-Fi, or Something Else Entirely?: <\/strong>When worldbuilding, think about how the genre shapes the &#8220;new setting.&#8221; A &#8220;fantasy novel&#8221; might lean into castles, enchanted forests, and ancient curses, while a &#8220;sci-fi&#8221; retelling could swap the &#8220;glass slipper&#8221; for a biometric key or set &#8220;Sleeping Beauty&#8221; in a cryogenic pod on a distant planet. The genre you choose will determine the rules of your world, from its technology to its magic system.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Keeping the Magic Alive: <\/strong>Even when you\u2019re reimagining the story in a &#8220;different era&#8221; or aesthetic, the heart of the fairy tale should remain intact. Retain iconic elements like the &#8220;magic lamp,&#8221; the poisoned apple, or the fairy godmother, but adapt them to fit logically into your new world. For instance, a &#8220;Red Riding Hood&#8221; set in a cyberpunk city might feature a hacker &#8220;wolf&#8221; and a GPS-tracked red hoodie.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Building an Atmosphere That Enchants: <\/strong>To fully transport readers, focus on creating a vivid, atmospheric world. Incorporate sensory details: How does the air smell in this enchanted forest? What\u2019s the hum of machinery like in your dystopian city? Take inspiration from &#8220;great examples&#8221; like Neil Gaiman\u2019s works, which are rich in texture and mood, blending whimsy and darkness in equal measure.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Fairy Tale Touchstones: <\/strong>Finally, don\u2019t forget to weave in small but essential nods to the &#8220;original tale&#8221;\u2014those magical touchstones that anchor the reader in the story. The trick is to incorporate them subtly and logically so they enhance your world without feeling forced. After all, the best retellings are those where the magic feels like it belongs, whether in a castle or on a starship.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With the right worldbuilding, your readers won\u2019t just read your &#8220;unique fairy tale retelling&#8221;\u2014they\u2019ll <em>live<\/em> it. So, grab your &#8220;plot points&#8221; and start building!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXeb-x0Doe7dMKFKPRzT6LFd165j43FPHtuuJ5mA6GSprEre9f4y-DpdqHKBasUbyHKp7pb-7RNAZxN70mfoVAysL62IFSE0d0QwKwpbKFzZ6s0SgDR2W8HyzgJVI7wSYSBqp-Y?key=bxyz36PFdC__2h6mnPLabCsl\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Characters in a New Light: Casting Your Tale<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fairy tale characters are iconic\u2014there\u2019s the &#8220;wicked witch,&#8221; the &#8220;young woman&#8221; with big dreams, the charming prince, and, of course, the always-underappreciated &#8220;side characters.&#8221; But if you want to craft a &#8220;unique fairy tale retelling,&#8221; it\u2019s time to break out your magic wand (or keyboard) and breathe new life into these archetypes. The goal? Make them fresh, dynamic, and unforgettable while still giving readers a hint of that fairy tale nostalgia.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Archetype to Fully Fleshed-Out People<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Start with your protagonist. Sure, she could be the damsel in distress, but why not turn her into a warrior, a scholar, or even a reluctant hero who\u2019d rather stay home than save the kingdom? That &#8220;young woman&#8221; can be more than a pretty face waiting for true love\u2014she could be an inventor, a detective, or a self-proclaimed villain out for redemption. The possibilities are endless, and the more layered your characters, the more your readers will connect with them.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Side Characters Stealing the Show<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Don\u2019t forget the &#8220;side characters&#8221; who often get lost in the shuffle. Maybe the prince\u2019s sassy best friend is secretly the brains of the operation, or the talking mirror in &#8220;Snow White&#8221; has his own tragic backstory. Giving these characters depth and agency can elevate your &#8220;own story&#8221; from predictable to exceptional.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Humanizing Villains and Surprising Allies<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Every &#8220;wicked witch&#8221; deserves her side of the story, and every &#8220;fairy godmother&#8221; has a past. Maybe your witch is a misunderstood outcast trying to protect her homeland, or your godmother is a retired magic dealer trying to go legit. By humanizing your villains and allies, you\u2019ll create a cast of characters with relatable flaws, motivations, and dreams. After all, readers love a &#8220;not-so-evil queen&#8221; with a snarky sense of humor or a fairy godmother with a grudge.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Motivations That Matter<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>No matter how fantastical your characters are, they need emotions and motivations that feel real. Why does the villain want revenge? Why is the hero so desperate for that magic lamp? When characters act from relatable desires\u2014like love, fear, ambition, or self-discovery\u2014readers will care about their journey, no matter how many talking animals or enchanted forests they encounter.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Reimagining your &#8220;classic fairy tale&#8221; characters is the key to creating a &#8220;great fairy tale retelling.&#8221; So, dive deep, ask tough questions, and don\u2019t be afraid to let your villains cry or your heroes falter. In the end, the characters will be what your readers remember most\u2014long after the &#8220;glass slipper&#8221; fits.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Weaving the Story Inside: Writing the First Draft<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What is the hardest part of writing a &#8220;great fairy tale retelling&#8221;? Starting. Staring at a blank page can feel more intimidating than facing down a &#8220;wicked witch.&#8221; But here\u2019s a little secret: your first draft doesn\u2019t need to be perfect\u2014it just needs to exist. So, grab your pen (or keyboard) and get to it! Remember, \u201cevery first draft has a glass slipper that doesn\u2019t quite fit.\u201d That\u2019s what editing is for.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you dive in, take a moment to map out your story. A good retelling balances &#8220;two stories&#8221;\u2014the &#8220;original tale&#8221; and your reimagined spin. Identify the key &#8220;plot points&#8221; you want to keep (like the iconic ball in <em>Cinderella<\/em> or the poisoned apple in <em>Snow White<\/em>) and figure out how they fit into your &#8220;new story.&#8221; Weaving the &#8220;source material&#8221; into your fresh perspective can be tricky, but with a solid outline, you\u2019ll know exactly where the magic happens.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pacing: Short vs. Long<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you crafting a quick, punchy short story or a sprawling &#8220;fantasy novel&#8221;? Pacing will vary depending on the format. Short stories require laser focus\u2014zeroing in on one pivotal moment or unique angle of the tale. Novels, on the other hand, give you room to expand, explore subplots, and dive deep into your characters\u2019 arcs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>From Spark to Scene<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When the &#8220;first spark&#8221; of inspiration hits, grab it before it slips away. Don\u2019t worry about making each scene perfect\u2014just get your ideas on paper. Need a nudge? Start with the scene that excites you most, whether it\u2019s a reimagined ball in a &#8220;modern setting&#8221; or a battle of wits between a &#8220;wicked witch&#8221; and her rebellious apprentice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Let the Slipper Fit Later<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Drafting isn\u2019t about perfection\u2014it\u2019s about discovery. Embrace the messiness and unexpected twists. You can fix the pacing, polish the dialogue, and adjust the tone later. For now, just write. Because the only thing scarier than a blank page is a story left untold.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are you waiting for? Start weaving your story and trust that even the wonkiest first draft has the potential to become your &#8220;own version&#8221; of a &#8220;great fairy tale retelling.&#8221;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXcYuhS7Hc9vz1PdWBQCTBkRJQrUD6a0w8ljq8w7Gw_XILuVA_DEHrJZbWxJ6FuuEbq-CGS57xB-x3G0bnCAmXoVbGiioJ5UI6CGR6d3gpYbiVkk2c4qvVCUeuCsC3HSvWcjQTpJXg?key=bxyz36PFdC__2h6mnPLabCsl\" alt=\"\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Polishing the Magic: Editing and Refining<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once your first draft is complete, congratulations\u2014you\u2019ve spun straw into\u2026 well, something that <em>might<\/em> be gold. Now it\u2019s time for the &#8220;nitty-gritty&#8221; part of the process: editing. This is where you refine your story, ensuring it\u2019s clear, engaging, and stays true to your vision. Think of it as carving a diamond out of the rough\u2014except your \u201cdiamond\u201d is a &#8220;great fairy tale retelling,&#8221; and your \u201crough\u201d probably includes at least one plot hole and a character who vanishes halfway through.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Editing can feel like wielding a very sharp wand, especially when you need to cut scenes, characters, or descriptions you adore. But if a beloved passage doesn\u2019t serve the story, it has to go. As the saying goes, \u201cKill your darlings\u201d\u2014but, of course, spare the fairy godmother unless her backstory <em>really<\/em> drags things down. Every word should propel your &#8220;new story idea&#8221; forward.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beta readers and critique partners are invaluable allies on your editing journey. Look for people familiar with original fairy tales, tale retellings or your chosen genre\u2014they\u2019ll know when your &#8220;magic lamp&#8221; shines and when it flickers. Honest feedback can help you spot weak &#8220;plot points,&#8221; confusing scenes, or characters that need more depth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For grammar and style, tools like ProWritingAid or Grammarly are your best friends. They can help you clean up clunky sentences, catch typos, and ensure your prose is as polished as Cinderella\u2019s &#8220;glass slipper.&#8221; Just remember: no automated tool can replace your own judgment, so don\u2019t lose your unique voice in the process.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Editing is where your &#8220;own story&#8221; transforms from a rough draft to a dazzling retelling. Be patient, trust the process, and don\u2019t be afraid to make bold cuts or revisions. In the end, the effort will be worth it when your tale shines like a &#8220;great example&#8221; of innovative storytelling. Now, polish that magic\u2014your readers are waiting!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sharing the Tale: Publishing Your Retelling<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you\u2019ve woven your &#8220;unique fairy tale retelling,&#8221; polished it to perfection, and are ready to set it free into the world. But how do you share your writing of fairy tale retellings so that readers can discover it? The good news is there are multiple paths to publishing, whether you\u2019re dreaming of landing a traditional book deal or exploring the freedom of self-publishing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Traditional Path<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your retelling of most fairy tales is a full-length &#8220;fantasy novel,&#8221; traditional publishing might be the way to go. Start by querying literary agents who specialize in fantasy or fairytale-inspired works. Your pitch should highlight what makes your retelling stand out\u2014whether it\u2019s a &#8220;villain\u2019s perspective&#8221; twist or a jaw-dropping &#8220;new genre&#8221; setting like sci-fi. Agents are always looking for fresh takes on familiar stories, so make sure your &#8220;own version&#8221; sparkles with originality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Self-Publishing Route<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For shorter works or niche &#8220;fairy tale retellings,&#8221; self-publishing offers a direct path to readers. This is where<a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/\"> Spines<\/a> shines!

With Spines, you can bring the other story or your retelling to life exactly the way you envision it\u2014no gatekeepers, just creative freedom.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Anthologies and Short Story Collections<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another trend in the fairy tale world is submitting &#8220;short stories&#8221; to themed anthologies. These collections often feature retellings from a variety of authors and are a great way to get your work in front of an audience. Research publishers or competitions focused on fairy tale themes, and write and submit your best work.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Marketing Your Tale<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you go traditional or indie, marketing is essential. Leverage social media to share the magic behind your story\u2014think character art, dreamy quotes, or even behind-the-scenes peeks at your creative process.
