In reality, no one is exempt from these struggles, but as long as you know how to manage situations that are inherently difficult or uncomfortable, you can endure, or even thrive. There are many tools that may be effective in dealing with these situations or emotions; among the most effective, and possibly life-changing, is writing, often referred to as &#8216;Writing as Therapy&#8217;.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10321 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-1024x683.jpeg\" alt=\"Writing as Therapy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-1024x683.jpeg 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-300x200.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-768x512.jpeg 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-1536x1024.jpeg 1536w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-2048x1365.jpeg 2048w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/AdobeStock_286032225-600x400.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing can help relieve the fog or turmoil in your head. Jotting thoughts down can be cathartic, especially if you\u2019ve never admitted something to yourself, before. The act of writing is putting invisible thoughts and concepts into the physical world on paper, and can make those ideas feel more real, more concrete, and potentially more manageable. Writing can also help with<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizing your thoughts<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Prioritizing your responsibilities<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaining perspective on past events<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Connecting to yourself as author and reader<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gaining more familiarity with your inner world<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\u00a0If you\u2019re considering using writing as an instrument for healing, you might want to try free writing &#8211; writing that isn\u2019t limited to a particular subject or goal. In free writing, there are no rules, and you can be as ridiculous, random, or scattered as you want. You don\u2019t need talent or experience as a writer to do it &#8211; you just need to commit to sitting down and putting down whatever thoughts you have. Also known as intuitive writing, it can be a powerful way to unload repetitive thoughts, or get your brain into a logical state so you can figure out something that has been bothering you; by writing, you give your mind permission to digest and rearrange your thoughts and feelings.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2>Writing as Therapy<\/h2>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-10319 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3-1024x576.png\" alt=\"Writing as Therapy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3-600x338.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/3.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some tips on using free\/intuitive writing:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to give full freedom to your thoughts and feelings without editing yourself. No one will ever have to read it, not even you.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t need to write neatly, in full sentences, or even coherent thoughts. If you feel it\u2019s easier to put down single words or images, start there. You can begin by writing in prose and end up writing a poem or a song. There are no rules or limitations, you are guided by what feels good in the moment to jot down.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Decide before you sit down how long you will devote to writing. When you finally sit down to write, push yourself to keep writing, without stopping, for the whole time. There may be times you feel stuck or like you have nothing to write &#8211; you can even write \u201cMy head is empty\u201d or \u201cI can\u2019t think of anything\u201d. Eventually, that will make you feel a certain way, and if you put down the way you\u2019re feeling, eventually you\u2019ll get back into a flow.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-10323\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4-600x338.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/4.png 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ultimately, those who get serious <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/about\/\">about<\/a> their writing habits eventually ask themselves the question &#8211; is this something I should share or even publish? Of course, the answer is different for everyone, because we all have different comfort levels about how much of ourselves we wish to share publicly. But on the subject of writing as a tool for <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Therapy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">therapy<\/a>, know that sharing has the potential to be a great source of healing, in and of itself.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With the publication of your words, you are no longer alone. Your words will be read and felt by many people, and you may find people responding with praise, thanks, or empathy. Publishing your writing is an act of bravery, and the permission you give yourself to share can have a ripple effect on others who have felt nervous about sharing their own stories.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publishing your work is a rite of passage &#8211; it symbolizes a physical and emotional release. Things you\u2019ve held onto in solitude are now a part of the world. This can be helpful for letting go of thoughts and feelings you\u2019ve harbored silently for a long time.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing is chicken soup for the soul; it facilitates, comforts, and empowers. Set aside a regular day and time to sit down and spill what\u2019s on your mind and heart onto the page, and you may find that the journey of writing is a journey into yourself.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a perfect world, you would never feel the weight of stress, the bitter taste of disappointment or feelings of failure, melancholy, and regret.
