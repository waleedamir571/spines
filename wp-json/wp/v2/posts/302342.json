But here\u2019s the thing: not all conflicts are created equal. Some happen inside the character&#8217;s head (the internal conflict), and others come from the outside world (the external conflict). Understanding the difference between the two is essential for crafting dynamic characters and compelling plots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this blog, we\u2019ll break down the internal vs external conflict debate, explain what each one really means, and show you how both can make your stories not just more engaging, but unforgettable. So grab your popcorn, because we\u2019re diving into the drama that drives every great narrative!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What is Internal vs External Conflict?&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In short: internal conflict is the battle within a character\u2019s mind, while external conflict comes from forces outside of them\u2014other characters, society, nature, or events. Both push the character toward growth, but in different ways. Internal conflict forces introspection and personal change, while external conflict drives action and challenges. Both are necessary for a well-rounded, engaging story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Internal Conflict Definition: The Battle Within<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, internal conflict\u2014where the real drama happens. It&#8217;s not about evil villains or high-speed chases; it\u2019s about the messy, complicated stuff happening inside a character\u2019s mind. Picture it: your character is wrestling with their own emotions, desires, or moral dilemmas. One moment, they want to save the world, and the next, they\u2019re doubting their ability to do so. It\u2019s the classic <em>man vs. self<\/em> showdown.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why does internal conflict matter? Simple: it makes characters <em>human<\/em>. We\u2019ve all faced those moments when we\u2019re torn between doing what\u2019s right and what feels easier, or struggling to choose between following our heart or our head. When done right, internal conflict lets readers or viewers connect with the character on a deeper level, making their triumphs feel earned and their failures relatable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Examples? Oh, we&#8217;ve got them. Think of Hamlet\u2019s indecisiveness, or Harry Potter&#8217;s struggle with the darkness inside him. These characters aren\u2019t just fighting external forces\u2014they\u2019re battling with themselves. And that\u2019s where the real story lies.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">External Conflict Definition: The World Against Them<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, let\u2019s talk about the kind of conflict that\u2019s a little more&#8230; <em>out there<\/em>. External conflict is the world piling on obstacles, challenges, and bad guys\u2014pretty much everything outside a character\u2019s head. It\u2019s the <em>man vs. man<\/em>, <em>man vs. nature<\/em>, or <em>man vs. society<\/em> kind of conflict. This is the kind of struggle where the character\u2019s enemies aren\u2019t just internal; they\u2019re real-world forces that want to take them down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it\u2019s a hero facing off against a villain, a team trying to survive a natural disaster, or a character fighting an oppressive society, external conflict creates the tension that keeps readers on the edge of their seats. Think about Katniss Everdeen battling the Capitol in <em>The Hunger Games<\/em>, or Frodo Baggins trying to destroy the One Ring while dodging orcs. These external battles keep the plot moving forward and drive characters to take action.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here\u2019s the kicker\u2014external conflict alone can feel one-dimensional. It\u2019s the internal struggle that gives the external conflict its emotional punch. When a character faces an outside threat while also wrestling with their inner demons, that\u2019s when things get really interesting. And let\u2019s be honest, a good external conflict makes for some epic fight scenes. Who doesn\u2019t love a good showdown?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Clash of Titans: Key Differences Between Internal and External Conflict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve got the lowdown on both types of conflict, let\u2019s break it down and compare. It&#8217;s like the ultimate face-off: <em>Internal Conflict<\/em> vs <em>External Conflict<\/em>\u2014who&#8217;s the true hero of your story?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-table\"><table class=\"has-fixed-layout\"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Aspect<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>Internal Conflict<\/strong><\/td><td><strong>External Conflict<\/strong><\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>What It Is<\/strong><\/td><td>A struggle within the character\u2019s mind, emotions, or values.<\/td><td>A battle with external forces like other people, nature, or society.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Source<\/strong><\/td><td>Comes from the character\u2019s own thoughts, fears, or desires.<\/td><td>Arises from outside the character\u2014usually antagonists, events, or circumstances.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Impact on Character<\/strong><\/td><td>Focuses on personal growth, moral dilemmas, and emotional development.<\/td><td>Tests the character\u2019s strength, courage, and survival instincts.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Examples<\/strong><\/td><td>Hamlet\u2019s indecision, a character\u2019s fear of failure.<\/td><td>Harry Potter fighting Voldemort, Katniss facing the Capitol.<\/td><\/tr><tr><td><strong>Purpose in Story<\/strong><\/td><td>Drives character development and self-discovery.<\/td><td>Propels the plot and forces characters to take action.<\/td><\/tr><\/tbody><\/table><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, while internal conflict tends to stir the emotional pot and external conflict keeps the story moving, both are essential for a well-rounded narrative. The trick is in knowing how to balance them\u2014like mixing the perfect amount of salt and pepper. Too much of one, and you might lose depth; too much of the other, and the plot might feel flat. It\u2019s the harmony between the two that makes a story truly <em>great<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Think of it this way: internal conflict is the fuel that powers a character\u2019s choices, while external conflict is the obstacle they have to face once they make those choices. Together, they create a narrative that\u2019s rich, compelling, and impossible to put down.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Conflict Combo: How Internal and External Struggles Work Together<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, here\u2019s where things get exciting: what happens when internal and external conflict collide? The result? A dynamic, multi-layered story that packs an emotional punch while keeping readers on the edge of their seats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When both types of conflict are at play, the stakes are higher. The character isn\u2019t just fighting off a villain, surviving a disaster, or conquering the elements\u2014they\u2019re doing it while battling with their own fears, doubts, or desires. It\u2019s the kind of tension that makes you shout, \u201cCome on, just make the right choice already!\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Take <em>The Great Gatsby<\/em>, for example. Gatsby is dealing with all sorts of external conflict\u2014his love for Daisy, the social class divide, and the disillusionment of the American Dream. But at the same time, he\u2019s fighting an internal battle over his past, his sense of self-worth, and his desperate hope for a future that can never be. That internal struggle makes the external conflicts hit harder, and it\u2019s part of what makes Gatsby such a tragic character.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, in <em>Star Wars<\/em>, Luke Skywalker faces external conflict in the form of the Empire, but the real drama lies in his internal struggle: does he follow in his father\u2019s footsteps, or choose a different path? His journey is defined by both, and the tension between his internal desires and the external forces acting on him shapes the entire narrative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, when writing your own stories, don\u2019t just think of internal and external conflict as separate entities. They should dance together, creating layers of meaning and tension that make your characters&#8217; journeys feel earned, relatable, and emotionally resonant. After all, when a character faces the world while wrestling with their own inner demons, the drama becomes <em>unforgettable<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"574\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-17.39.25.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-302344\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-17.39.25.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-17.39.25-300x168.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-17.39.25-768x431.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-17.39.25-360x202.png 360w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-08-01-at-17.39.25-600x336.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">How to Use Internal vs External Conflict in Your Writing: A Guide for the Brave<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we\u2019ve unpacked the <em>what<\/em> and <em>why<\/em> of internal and external conflict, let\u2019s dive into how you can wield both of these storytelling powerhouses in your own <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/coaching\/\">writing<\/a>. Ready to make your readers sweat with anticipation? Let\u2019s go!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Start with Your Character&#8217;s Core Dilemma<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether it&#8217;s internal or external conflict, start by defining what your character <em>wants<\/em> and what they <em>need<\/em>. Do they want to be the hero, but secretly doubt they have what it takes (hello, internal conflict)? Or are they up against an oppressive system that\u2019s trying to crush their spirit (external conflict)? By understanding what drives your character, you\u2019ll know which conflict types will fuel their journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Create a Balance Between Both Conflicts<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Don\u2019t just throw a villain at your character and call it a day. Sure, external conflict (the action-packed stuff) is crucial, but don\u2019t forget about that emotional, psychological battle within. Mix them up! Let the external conflict force the character into decisions that fuel their internal conflict. For example, a character might have to make a tough moral choice in the heat of battle\u2014this is where internal and external conflicts meet head-on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Use Internal Conflict to Amplify the Stakes<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes, the external conflict alone isn&#8217;t enough to get your readers hooked. Enter internal conflict. If your character is torn between doing what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s easy, or struggles with feelings of inadequacy, it adds another layer of complexity to their actions. The more the internal conflict intensifies, the more emotionally invested your audience will become in how your character handles (or crumbles under) the pressure. It makes their victory (or defeat) much more rewarding.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Add External Conflict as a Catalyst for Internal Growth<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Let the external forces act as a mirror to the character\u2019s internal struggles. The challenges your character faces in the outside world should force them to confront their fears, insecurities, or deeply held beliefs. Think of it as the world pushing your character to grow. External conflict might kickstart a character\u2019s self-reflection, sparking the internal struggle that will eventually lead to transformation. It&#8217;s like throwing your character into the deep end\u2014how they navigate the world around them will reveal their true inner self.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Don\u2019t Forget the Resolution<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The ultimate goal is for your <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/crafting-believable-round-characters\/\">character to grow and change<\/a>. The resolution of both the internal and external conflicts should coincide in a way that feels satisfying. The external conflict might be resolved by an epic battle or climactic confrontation, but the internal conflict needs to be dealt with too. Maybe your character comes to terms with their flaws or finds peace with the decisions they\u2019ve made. Both conflicts should conclude in a way that shows how far your character has come.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By strategically combining internal and external conflict, you\u2019ll create a rich, multi-dimensional narrative that resonates long after the last page is turned. It\u2019s all about balance\u2014let the external world challenge your character, while their inner turmoil drives the heart of the story. When you get it right, the result will be a conflict-rich masterpiece that leaves readers begging for more.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Wrapping Up the Conflict: Why It All Matters<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So, now that you\u2019ve got a solid understanding of internal vs. external conflict, why does it matter? Well, to put it simply: without conflict, you don\u2019t have a story. Conflict is the engine that powers your narrative, and knowing how to balance internal and external struggles gives your story depth, emotion, and drive.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By weaving both <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/the-7-types-of-conflict-in-literature\/\">types of conflict<\/a> together, you not only create more compelling characters but also craft a plot that feels full of tension and purpose. Whether it&#8217;s your hero battling their own fears or taking down an evil overlord, the real magic happens when both conflicts are in play. And that\u2019s where the heart of storytelling lies\u2014balancing the action with the introspection, the fight for survival with the journey for self-discovery.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next time you sit down to write, ask yourself: What is my character struggling with <em>inside<\/em>? What\u2019s the <em>outside<\/em> force pushing them? How do these two conflicts shape their choices, growth, and ultimate victory or failure? If you can answer these questions, you\u2019ll be well on your way to crafting a story that\u2019s as engaging as it is memorable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, get out there and write the drama! Your readers will thank you for it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading faq-header\">FAQs &#8211; Internal vs External Conflict<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What are examples of external vs internal?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>External conflicts often involve battles with other characters or forces outside the protagonist, like a hero fighting a villain or surviving a natural disaster. Internal conflicts, on the other hand, include struggles within the character&#8217;s mind, such as a character dealing with guilt, self-doubt, or conflicting desires. For example, in <em>The Lion King<\/em>, Simba faces an external conflict against Scar (the villain), while simultaneously dealing with internal conflict regarding his responsibility and guilt over his father&#8217;s death.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is the difference between internal and external influences?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internal influences come from within the character, such as emotions, personal beliefs, and values. These influences shape how the character thinks and behaves. External influences are outside forces\u2014other people, societal expectations, and environmental factors, that pressure or impact the character&#8217;s actions. For example, a character&#8217;s fear of failure (internal influence) might be intensified by external pressure from a mentor or the public (external influence).<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is the man vs man conflict?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man vs man conflict is a type of external conflict where one character faces opposition from another character. This is often the classic &#8220;hero vs villain&#8221; scenario, where the protagonist is actively engaged in a struggle against an antagonist. For example, in <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#8217;s Stone<\/em>, Harry\u2019s conflict with Voldemort exemplifies man vs man, as they are in direct opposition to one another.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What causes inner conflict?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inner conflict is caused by a clash of emotions, desires, or moral dilemmas within a character. These internal struggles might arise when a character must make a difficult choice or reconcile competing values. For instance, a character might struggle with deciding whether to follow their dreams or stay to take care of a loved one, leading to an emotional battle within themselves.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What is an example of an internal and external conflict?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A character might face both internal and external conflicts at the same time. For example, in <em>The Great Gatsby<\/em>, Gatsby\u2019s external conflict is with Tom Buchanan, Daisy\u2019s husband, whom he views as an obstacle to his love for Daisy. At the same time, Gatsby\u2019s internal conflict revolves around his obsession with recreating an idealized past, which ultimately leads to his downfall. This dual conflict intensifies his struggle and makes the story more compelling.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: Is character vs society internal or external?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Character vs society is an external conflict. It occurs when a character faces opposition from societal norms, laws, or the collective values of a community. An example of this is <em>1984<\/em> by George Orwell, where Winston Smith faces the oppressive regime of the Party, which controls and suppresses individual freedoms.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Q: What are the four main types of conflict?<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The four main types of conflict in storytelling are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Man vs man (external conflict between characters)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Man vs nature (external conflict with the environment)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Man vs society (external conflict with societal norms or laws)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Man vs self (internal conflict within a character\u2019s mind)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>These are the core categories used to classify conflict, and they help drive character development and plot progression in stories.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Every good story needs conflict, whether it\u2019s a character grappling with their own mind or battling an evil overlord; the struggle is what keeps us hooked.
