These costs add up fast. To put it into perspective, the average price to self-publish ranges anywhere from $2,000 to $15,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For better budgetary planning, let&#8217;s break down your expenses:\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Editors<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A freelance editor with junior-level experience may run anywhere from $1,000 to $3,000, while more established editors may charge up to $10,000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Cover Designers<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A graphic designer can cost $50 to $100 per hour. But, if you want someone with book designing experience, it may cost up to $500 to $1000.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Marketing Team<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: A professional marketing team can cost $1000 to $5000 (their time + ad costs). If you <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/book-formatting-services-why-choose-a-self-publishing-company-to-do-this-for-you\/\">choose to market the book yourself<\/a>, you can spend $100 to $1000 or more on social media ads.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Miscellaneous Production Expenses: <\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Extra production costs like formatting (think Kindle vs. paperback) can add an extra $200 to $500 to your expenses.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Adds up quickly, doesn\u2019t it? A realistic approach can save you serious money when all is said and done.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mistake #2: Choosing the wrong self-publishing platform\u00a0<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Depending on your needs, some self-publishing platforms might be better suited for your book than others. Some are better for print, while others are known for eBooks. Some platforms are genre-specific, which can help your book reach your target reader. You might consider those that offer hybrid services such as in-house formatting, cover design, and more.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider the following while doing your research:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Sales Goals:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Which distribution partners do they work with, do they match your writing style, how do they support your book?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Final Format:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you want more than one format, such as paperback and Kindle, make sure they can handle this.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Budget:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> What are you getting for your money, and can you afford them?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Additional Services or Support:<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The availability of extra services or support should you need them.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mistake #3: Hiring amateurs to handle self-publishing services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It&#8217;s always worth the investment to have professionals handle your book&#8217;s design, editing, and proofreading. First-time authors in particular may have a hard time figuring out if they&#8217;re working with an amateur or a professional, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">and they may be tempted to go with whatever is most affordable. For this reason, it may be beneficial to look into a complete publishing package from self-publishing platforms who have already vetted the quality of the experts they\u2019ve chosen to work with.<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not only do they have a large pool of professional editors and designers, but they also have the experience to guide you through the process.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Publishing services with access to AI technology can provide valuable insight into the Amazon bestseller list and even market trends that support a book&#8217;s success. Publishing services could also provide further insights, like knowing the best book covers have a heavy contrast between text and the background, or how to craft the perfect title to land your book on the top 100 list.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Take advantage of service companies and their expertise<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> &#8211; instead of <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">going it alone and finding out that you are disappointed with the result.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mistake #4: Undercutting your value with low royalties<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t sell yourself short over the excitement of an offer and accept a low <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Royalty_payment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">royalty<\/a>-free. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With traditional publishing houses at the lowest, giving writers as low as 5-15% in royalties, it isn\u2019t uncommon for authors to settle for less than they should when going the self-publishing route. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While some may give you up to 50% profit, Spines will offer up to 70% royalties; one of the highest royalty shares on the market.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">self-publishing mistakes &#8211; Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The secret to becoming a successful self-published author is taking advantage of the resources available to you. <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though a traditional <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/about\/\">publishing house has the resources to cover the cost of publishing your book<\/a>, they take a much higher percentage of your royalties and your freedom to make the final product what you want it to be &#8211; not to mention, you\u2019ll need to be chosen first, which can take years.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You became an author because you want your story shared with the world. Only you can weigh the pros and cons <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">between the time the overall publishing process may take, the upfront price you may have to pay, and the freedom of having complete creative control over your work.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The process of self-publishing has changed drastically over the years with technology making it increasingly more accessible &#8211; but many self-published books are riddled with grammatical errors, have terrible book covers, or inappropriate marketing campaigns (not everything has to be a Tik Tok video).
