You can have a brilliant idea, a strong story, or a killer argument, but if your writing is sprinkled with grammar mistakes, it can start to feel less polished and less trustworthy. Even small errors interrupt the flow, pull readers out of the moment, and make them reread a sentence when they should be nodding along.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clean grammar isn\u2019t about sounding fancy. It\u2019s about making your message easy to follow and hard to misunderstand. When your writing feels smooth, you sound more confident, more credible, and yes, more convincing. Good grammar <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/narrative-voice-development-crafting-a-unique-style\/\">sharpens your voice<\/a>.

The good news? Most of them aren\u2019t complicated. They\u2019re just sneaky. And once you know what to look for, they\u2019re ridiculously fast to fix.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In each of the mistakes below, you\u2019ll get:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>a quick explanation (no grammar lecture, promise)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>common English grammar mistakes examples (the kind you\u2019ve definitely seen before)<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>a simple correction tip you can apply instantly<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>a memory trick to help it stick<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>and a quick \u201cspot-it\u201d moment to sharpen your editing eye<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Ready? Let\u2019s clean up the grammar gremlins before they start biting your credibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Your vs. You\u2019re: The Most Popular Mix-Up on the Internet<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your vs. you\u2019re is basically the internet\u2019s favorite grammar tripwire, and one of the most common English grammar mistakes examples you\u2019ll see <em>everywhere<\/em>, from <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/email-marketing-for-authors-growing-your-reader-base\/\">comments to captions to professional emails<\/a>. Here\u2019s the rule: <em>your<\/em> shows ownership, while <em>you\u2019re<\/em> is a contraction for <em>you are<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: \u201cYour amazing\u201d technically means your <em>amazing thing<\/em> belongs to you. Nice, but probably not what you meant. The correct version is: \u201cYou\u2019re amazing.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> swap <em>you\u2019re<\/em> with <em>you are<\/em>. If the sentence still makes sense (\u201cYou are amazing\u201d), you need the apostrophe. If it doesn\u2019t (\u201cYou are phone is ringing\u201d), go with <em>your<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> apostrophes are tiny time-savers. Use them when you\u2019re shortening words, not when you\u2019re handing out ownership.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Its vs. It\u2019s: The Apostrophe That Betrays Everyone<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If grammar had a \u201cmost wanted\u201d list, <em>its vs. it\u2019s<\/em> would be on the cover. This tiny apostrophe causes chaos because it <em>looks<\/em> like it should show possession\u2026 but it doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the rule: <em>it\u2019s<\/em> is a contraction for <em>it is<\/em> or <em>it has<\/em>. Meanwhile, <em>its<\/em> is possessive, meaning something belongs to it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: \u201cIt\u2019s raining again\u201d = \u201cIt is raining again.\u201d<br>But: \u201cThe dog wagged its tail\u201d = the tail belongs to the dog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> swap <em>it\u2019s<\/em> with <em>it is<\/em>. If the sentence still works, keep the apostrophe. If it sounds weird (\u201cThe dog wagged it is tail\u201d), it should be <em>its<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> possessive pronouns don\u2019t wear apostrophes: <em>his, hers, its.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Then vs. Than: One Is Time, One Is Comparison&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Then<\/em> and <em>than<\/em> are proof that two tiny words can cause very big confusion, especially in casual writing, ads, and <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/social-media-for-authors-building-your-online-presence\/\">social posts where speed wins<\/a> and grammar loses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the difference: <em>then<\/em> relates to time or sequence (<em>first this, then that<\/em>). <em>Than<\/em> is used for comparisons (<em>bigger than<\/em>, <em>better than<\/em>, <em>more than<\/em>).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So: \u201cFinish your draft, <em>then<\/em> edit.\u201d<br>But: \u201cThis version is better <em>than<\/em> the last.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> if you can replace the word with <em>next<\/em>, it should be <em>then<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> <em>ThAn = compArison<\/em>: both have an <em>A<\/em>. And yes, <em>then<\/em> and <em>than<\/em> will keep trying to trick you. Don\u2019t let them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Subject-Verb Agreement: When Your Sentence Has Commitment Issues<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Subject-verb agreement is basically your sentence deciding whether it\u2019s going <em>solo<\/em> or showing up with a group. The rule is simple: a singular subject needs a singular verb, and a plural subject needs a plural verb. Easy\u2026 until English throws a decoy noun into the mix and watches you panic.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: \u201cA list of items <em>is<\/em> on the table.\u201d<br>Not <em>are<\/em>. Why? Because the subject is <em>list<\/em> (singular), not <em>items<\/em> (plural). Those items are just along for the ride.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> find the true subject, usually the main noun doing the action, not the noun sitting closest to the verb.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> ignore the extras in the middle of the sentence. Prepositional phrases like \u201cof the items,\u201d \u201cwith the team,\u201d or \u201calong with my friends\u201d love to distract you. Your verb should stay loyal to the real subject.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Run-On Sentences: The Olympic Marathon of Grammar Mistakes<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Run-on sentences happen when two (or three\u2026 or seven) complete thoughts decide to hold hands and refuse to let go. Usually it\u2019s not laziness, it\u2019s enthusiasm. You\u2019re excited, your brain is moving fast, and <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/make-my-sentence-sound-better\/\">suddenly your sentence becomes a sprint<\/a> that turns into a marathon with no water breaks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Humorous example: \u201cI started writing my book last night and I had one great idea and then another and I thought I should outline it but then I opened social media and now it\u2019s somehow three hours later.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. That\u2019s a run-on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> break it up with a period, use a semicolon, or add a conjunction like <em>and, but,<\/em> or <em>so<\/em> to connect ideas correctly.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> if you\u2019re out of breath reading it\u2026 so is the reader. Give your sentences a chance to breathe.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-1024x683.png\" alt=\"Illustrated grammar guide explaining comma splices, showing a common punctuation mistake and its correct form through a friendly visual example and simple sentence comparison.\" class=\"wp-image-355571\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-1024x683.png 1024w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-300x200.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-768x512.png 768w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-1536x1024.png 1536w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-360x240.png 360w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00-600x400.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2026\/01\/Screenshot-2026-01-12-at-12.00.00.png 1698w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Comma Splices: When a Comma Tries to Do a Period\u2019s Job<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A comma splice is what happens when a comma gets overconfident and tries to glue two full sentences together. It <em>almost<\/em> works (which is why it\u2019s so common) but it\u2019s still incorrect.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: \u201cI wrote the book, it was long.\u201d<br>That\u2019s two complete sentences pretending to be one.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> you have two easy options:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Split it into two sentences: \u201cI wrote the book. It was long.\u201d<br><\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Add a conjunction: \u201cI wrote the book, and it was long.\u201d<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Both fixes take about two seconds and instantly make your writing clearer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> commas connect, periods separate. If your comma is trying to do a period\u2019s job, it\u2019s time for a promotion (or a replacement).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Misplaced Apostrophes: The \u201890s Called\u2026 They Want Their Plural Back<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Misplaced apostrophes are everywhere: on store signs, Instagram captions, even brand copy that <em>should<\/em> know better. And once you see them, you can\u2019t unsee them. The classic mistake? Using an apostrophe to make a word plural: \u201capple\u2019s,\u201d \u201cbook\u2019s,\u201d \u201csale\u2019s.\u201d (Somewhere, an English teacher just sighed.)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the rule: apostrophes are only for <strong>possession<\/strong> (<em>the author\u2019s book<\/em>) or <strong>contractions<\/strong> (<em>it\u2019s, you\u2019re, don\u2019t<\/em>). That\u2019s it. No apostrophe required just because there\u2019s more than one apple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> if you\u2019re just making something plural, add <em>s<\/em> (or <em>es<\/em>), nothing else.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> if it\u2019s more than one, skip the apostrophe. Your plurals will thank you.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Affect vs. Effect: The Confusing Cousins of English<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Even professionals argue about this one, usually right before quietly opening a new tab to double-check. <em>Affect<\/em> and <em>effect<\/em> are the confusing cousins of English: related, constantly around each other, and easy to mix up at family gatherings.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s the simple rule: <em>affect<\/em> is usually a <strong>verb<\/strong> meaning <em>to influence<\/em>. <em>Effect<\/em> is usually a <strong>noun<\/strong> meaning <em>the result<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: \u201cThe weather can <em>affect<\/em> your mood.\u201d<br>\u201cThe <em>effect<\/em> was immediate.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> if you can put <em>the<\/em> in front of it (\u201cthe effect\u201d), you want <em>effect<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> RAVEN &#8211; <em>Remember: Affect = Verb, Effect = Noun.<\/em><em><br><\/em>Once you memorize that, you\u2019ll look like a grammar wizard\u2026 and no one has to know it took you two minutes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Who vs. Whom: The Grammar Mistake That Feels Fancy<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Who vs. whom<\/em> is the grammar mistake that makes everyone feel like they should be wearing a monocle. But the rule is actually simple: <em>who<\/em> is a <strong>subject<\/strong> (doing the action), and <em>whom<\/em> is an <strong>object<\/strong> (receiving the action).<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> replace the word with <em>he<\/em> or <em>him<\/em>.<br>If <em>he<\/em> fits, use <em>who<\/em>. If <em>him<\/em> fits, use <em>whom<\/em>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: \u201cWhom should I email?\u201d \u2192 \u201cI should email <em>him<\/em>.\u201d \u2714<br>So, <em>whom<\/em> is correct.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> <em>whom<\/em> ends with <em>M<\/em>, like <em>him<\/em>.<br>If it feels fancy, you\u2019re probably doing it right.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sentence Fragments: When Your Sentence Ghosts You<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A sentence fragment is what happens when your sentence <em>starts strong\u2026 and then disappears<\/em>. It\u2019s an <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/sentence-fragment-examples\/\">incomplete thought pretending to be a full sentence<\/a>, usually because it begins with words like <em>Because, Although, Which,<\/em> or <em>While<\/em>, and never finishes the idea.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Example: \u201cBecause I was exhausted.\u201d<br>Okay\u2026 because you were exhausted <em>what<\/em>? Slept? Quit? Ordered takeout? We need closure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fast fix:<\/em> attach the fragment to the sentence before it or complete the thought.<br>Correct: \u201cI went to bed early because I was exhausted.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Memory trick:<\/em> if it can\u2019t stand alone, it\u2019s not a sentence.<br>Fragments can be used for style sometimes, but when they\u2019re accidental, they just leave the reader hanging like a cliffhanger with no sequel.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Quick Grammar Fix Checklist: The 60-Second Proofread<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No time to proofread properly?

But most guides agree on these <em>11 core grammar rules<\/em> that cover the basics of clear English:<\/p>\n<p><em>Use complete sentences<\/em> (subject + verb).<\/p>\n<p><em>Match subjects and verbs<\/em> (singular\/plural agreement).<\/p>\n<p><em>Keep verb tense consistent<\/em> (don\u2019t time-travel mid-sentence).<\/p>\n<p><em>Use pronouns correctly<\/em> (who\/whom, I\/me, etc.).<\/p>\n<p><em>Place modifiers near what they describe<\/em> (avoid confusion).<\/p>\n<p><em>Use punctuation properly<\/em> (<a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/what-are-punctuation-marks\/\">commas, periods, apostrophes<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p><em>Avoid sentence fragments<\/em> unless you\u2019re doing it intentionally for style.<\/p>\n<p><em>Avoid run-ons and comma splices<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p><em>Use parallel structure<\/em> (keep lists consistent).<\/p>\n<p><em>Use articles correctly<\/em> (<em>a<\/em>, <em>an<\/em>, <em>the<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p><em>Use proper capitalization<\/em> (especially in names and titles).<\/p>\n<p>Think of these as<em> the grammar rules that keep your writing from wobbling.<\/em><\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1768211236092\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<p class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: What is the hardest grammar rule in English?<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>For most people, the hardest rule is subject-verb agreement in complex sentences, especially when there are phrases in between.<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<p>Correct:  \u201cA bouquet of roses <em>smells<\/em> wonderful.\u201d<br \/>Incorrect: \u201cA bouquet of roses <em>smell<\/em> wonderful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Why it\u2019s tricky: your brain wants to match the verb to the closest noun (<em>roses<\/em>), not the real subject (<em>bouquet<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>Other contenders for \u201chardest\u201d include:<\/p>\n<p><em>who vs. whom<br \/><\/em><br \/><em>affect vs. effect<br \/><\/em><br \/>But subject-verb agreement is the one that trips people most consistently.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1768211295240\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<p class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: What are dangling modifiers?<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>A dangling modifier is a descriptive phrase that doesn\u2019t clearly attach to the right subject, so the sentence accidentally suggests something <em>unintended<\/em> (and often hilarious).<\/p>\n<p>Example:<\/p>\n<p>Incorrect:  \u201cWalking down the street, the trees were beautiful.\u201d<br \/>This makes it sound like <em>the trees<\/em> were walking.<\/p>\n<p>Correct:  Fix: \u201cWalking down the street, I noticed the trees were beautiful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quick rule:<\/strong> the noun doing the action should come right after the modifier.<\/p>\n<p>Dangling modifiers are like bad GPS instructions: they <em>technically<\/em> point somewhere, but not where you meant.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1768211330174\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<p class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: What are the most common writing mistakes?<\/strong><\/p>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Here are the most common writing mistakes (and yes, even good writers make them):<\/p>\n<p><strong>Grammar mix-ups<\/strong> (<em>your\/you\u2019re, its\/it\u2019s, then\/than<\/em>)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Run-on sentences and comma splices<br \/><\/strong><br \/><strong>Vague or wordy writing<\/strong> (too many filler phrases)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Weak verbs and overuse of \u201cwas\/were\u201d<br \/><\/strong><br \/><strong>Overusing passive voice<br \/><\/strong><br \/><strong>Inconsistent <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/types-of-writing-styles\/\"><strong>tone<\/strong><\/a> (formal \u2192 casual \u2192 formal again)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lack of structure<\/strong> (no clear flow or transitions)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Repetition<\/strong> (same words or phrases too often)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Punctuation errors<\/strong> (especially commas and apostrophes)<\/p>\n<p><strong>Not proofreading aloud<\/strong> (the fastest way to catch awkward phrasing)<\/p>\n<p>A good rule: clarity wins.
