You\u2019d submit your manuscript, cross your fingers, and\u2014if all went well\u2014wait six months to a year for your book to finally hit the shelves of a local bookstore (if it even got there). It was a process so slow and cumbersome, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking you were publishing in the 18th century rather than the 21st. Now, with modern book distribution, times have changed<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of wrestling with dusty shelves and stubborn gatekeepers, authors can take control of their book&#8217;s destiny. With digital platforms and print-on-demand services, publishing has transformed into a faster, more efficient process that offers global reach. The kicker? You don\u2019t need to be J.K. Rowling or George R.R. Martin to make it happen.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here\u2019s a stat to perk up your morning coffee: <strong>self-published books now account for 30-34% of all eBook sales on Amazon.<\/strong> That\u2019s right\u2014nearly a third of the world\u2019s biggest eBook marketplace is dominated by self-published authors like you, who have bypassed traditional publishers and embraced the digital revolution.

Gone are the days when authors solely relied on physical bookstores and well-connected publishers to get their books into readers\u2019 hands. Independent bookstores now play a crucial role in the distribution network, fostering community engagement and offering personalized customer service. Independent publishers also contribute significantly by providing authors with support services such as editing, design, and distribution, striking a balance between traditional and self-publishing models. With the rise of digital platforms, self-published authors now have unprecedented access to a global audience. Traditional bookstores still hold their charm, but the true power lies in merging both print and digital strategies to expand your reach. Additionally, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/how-to-use-hybrid-book-distribution-models\/\">hybrid book distribution<\/a> is on the rise, thanks to the combination of technology and traditional distribution.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/sign-up\/\">Spines<\/a> understands this evolution better than anyone.

Gone are the days when authors had to rely solely on traditional publishers to print, distribute, and market their books. Today, the lines between traditional and self-publishing have blurred, giving authors unprecedented control over their publishing journey.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine you\u2019re no longer at the mercy of a publishing gatekeeper.
