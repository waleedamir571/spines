Do you italicize them? Do you underline them? Do the rules change if it is a series or a children\u2019s book?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The truth is, this tiny detail confuses a lot of people, and for good reason. Style rules have shifted over time, and what your teacher told you in school might not line up with what modern publishing expects. That is why it helps to clear it up once and for all.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s sort through the rules around book titles, chapter names, and series so you know exactly when italics are the right choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are Book Titles Italicized? The Short Answer<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, book titles are italicized in almost every modern style guide. If you are writing an essay, a blog, or even a manuscript, putting a book title in italics is the standard way to show readers that you are referring to a published work. For example, you would write <em>Pride and Prejudice<\/em> instead of Pride and Prejudice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one small wrinkle though. In the past, when typewriters and handwritten assignments were the norm, people underlined book titles instead of italicizing them. Underlining was easier to see and stood in for italics. Today, italics are the preferred choice, and underlining only comes up if you are writing by hand and cannot use italics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are sitting at a keyboard and wondering <em>are book titles italicized,<\/em> the quick and simple answer is yes.<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Book Titles Are Italicized in Writing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Italics might feel like a tiny detail, but they actually serve a big purpose. When you see a title set apart in italics, your brain instantly knows, <em>oh, that\u2019s the name of a book.<\/em> It keeps the sentence clean and helps you separate the title from the rest of the words around it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re reading a sentence that says:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just finished The Midnight Library last week<em>.<\/em>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without italics, the title doesn\u2019t pop, and you might skim right past it like it\u2019s just part of the sentence. Now look at it again with italics:&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just finished <em>The Midnight Library<\/em> last week<em>.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Suddenly the book title stands out, and your eyes know right away that it\u2019s something separate from the rest of the text. That tiny slant makes a big difference in clarity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tradition of italicizing titles also comes from publishing standards. Newspapers, magazines, and books have long used italics to make titles easy to spot, and academic style guides followed suit. Over time, it became the universal rule we rely on today.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, italics are not just about following rules for the sake of rules. They are about making your writing clear, professional, and easy for readers to follow.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are Book Titles Italicized or Underlined?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most common questions, and the answer depends on how and where you are writing. Today, italics are the standard in almost every situation. If you are typing on a computer, whether it is for school, work, or publication, italics are the way to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Underlining, on the other hand, is more of an old habit. Before italics were widely available on typewriters or when assignments were written by hand, underlining was the go-to method to show that a word was a book title. It was practical because a line under the text was easier to see on the page.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So which should you use now? If you are working digitally, choose italics every time. If you are handwriting something and can\u2019t italicize, underlining is still acceptable. Outside of those situations, italics are the clear and modern choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are Book Series Italicized?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, book series titles are italicized, just like individual book titles. If you are writing about <em>The Lord of the Rings<\/em> as a series, the entire series name gets italics. If you are talking about one of the books within that series, like <em>The Two Towers<\/em>, that title is italicized as well.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This rule applies across the board, whether you are referring to a fantasy saga, a trilogy of mysteries, or a set of children\u2019s books. Italics help readers instantly see that you are talking about a title, whether it belongs to one book or a larger collection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, if it is the name of a published work,&nbsp; whether that is a single book or a whole series,&nbsp; italics are the way to go.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are Book Chapter Titles Italicized?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No, chapter titles are not italicized. Instead, they are placed in quotation marks. This rule helps distinguish smaller parts of a book from the full work itself. Think of it this way: italics are reserved for the big works like books, movies, or newspapers, while quotation marks are used for shorter pieces that live inside those larger works.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if you are writing about the first chapter of <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\u2019s Stone<\/em>, you would format it as \u201cThe Boy Who Lived.\u201d The book title gets italics, but the chapter title sits inside quotation marks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This same approach applies to other short works too, like poems, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/short-story-elements\/\">short stories<\/a>, and articles. It keeps everything organized and makes it easy for the reader to know exactly what kind of title they are looking at.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Are Children\u2019s Book Titles Italicized?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, children\u2019s book titles follow the exact same rule as any other book; they should be italicized. Whether you are writing about classics like <em>Goodnight Moon<\/em> or more modern favorites like <em>Dragons Love Tacos<\/em>, the title gets italics.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes people assume that children\u2019s books might be treated differently because they are shorter or illustrated, but the format does not change the rule. A published book is a published book, no matter the audience. Italics help make that clear and keep your writing consistent.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, whether you are talking about a novel for adults, a young adult fantasy series, or a board book for toddlers, you can feel confident italicizing the title.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1704\" height=\"932\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2025\/08\/Screenshot-2025-09-24-at-15.49.38-1.png\" alt=\"A flat lay style image of an open book.

The short answer is yes, book titles are italicized in almost every modern context, whether you are writing an essay, blog, or manuscript. Underlining was once the standard for typewritten or handwritten work, but italics have replaced it as the preferred option.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Book series titles are italicized just like individual books, while chapter titles take quotation marks instead. Children\u2019s book titles follow the same rules as any other published work and should always be italicized.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The key takeaway is simple: italicize book titles and series names, use quotation marks for chapters or shorter works, and save underlining only for situations where italics are not possible. Following these rules makes your writing clear, professional, and easy for readers to understand.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Italicizing Book Titles FAQ<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:12px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"><\/div>\n\n\n<div id=\"rank-math-faq\" class=\"rank-math-block\">\n<div class=\"rank-math-list \">\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723909001\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Are book titles italicized?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Yes, in modern writing and publishing, book titles are italicized. Whether you are writing a school essay, a blog, or <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/what-is-a-manuscript\/\">preparing a manuscript<\/a>, italics are the standard way to show that a word or phrase is the title of a published book. For example, you would write <em>The Catcher in the Rye<\/em> instead of putting it in quotation marks. Italics make the title stand out from the rest of your sentence so readers instantly know you are referring to a book.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723918853\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Are book names italicized or put in quotes?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Book names are italicized, not put in quotation marks. Quotation marks are reserved for shorter works that live inside a larger one, such as poems, short stories, or book chapters. For instance, <em>The Hobbit<\/em> is italicized because it is a full book, while \u201cRiddles in the Dark\u201d (a chapter within it) goes in quotation marks. This distinction helps readers see the difference between a complete work and a smaller piece.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723926403\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Are book titles italicized or underlined?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Today, book titles are italicized almost everywhere. Underlining was once used when typewriters or handwritten work made italics impossible. Some teachers may still accept underlining in handwritten assignments, but in digital writing, italics are the modern rule. So if you are typing on a computer, always choose italics over underlining.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723935221\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Are book series italicized?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Yes, book series titles are italicized just like single book titles. If you are writing about <em>Harry Potter<\/em> as a series, the whole name gets italics. If you mention a specific book within the series, such as <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets<\/em>, that title is italicized too. The same rule applies whether you are talking about fantasy sagas, trilogies, or children\u2019s book series.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723943439\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Are book chapter titles italicized?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>No, chapter titles are not italicized. Instead, they go in quotation marks. For example, in <em>To Kill a Mockingbird<\/em>, the first chapter would be written as \u201cChapter One\u201d in quotation marks, while the book title remains italicized. This rule is consistent across all styles: italics for full-length works, quotation marks for parts of a larger whole.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723952770\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Are children\u2019s book titles italicized?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Yes, <a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/childrens-books\/\">children\u2019s books<\/a> are treated the same way as any other published book. Titles like <em>Goodnight Moon<\/em> and <em>Where the Wild Things Are<\/em> should be italicized, even though they are shorter or illustrated. The audience or format of the book doesn\u2019t change the rule \u2014 a published book always gets italics.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723966204\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: What are common mistakes with italicizing book titles?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Writers often make a few common errors. Some forget to italicize subtitles, writing <em>The Great Gatsby: A Novel<\/em> without formatting the subtitle. Others use quotation marks for books, which is incorrect. Another mistake is mixing styles, like bolding or capitalizing a title instead of italicizing it. The simplest way to avoid these issues is to remember: italics for books and series, quotation marks for shorter works.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div id=\"faq-question-1758723984886\" class=\"rank-math-list-item\">\n<h6 class=\"rank-math-question \"><strong>Q: Do different style guides have different rules for book titles?<\/strong><\/h6>\n<div class=\"rank-math-answer \">\n\n<p>Most modern style guides agree that book titles should be italicized, but the details can vary slightly. MLA, APA, and Chicago Manual of Style all recommend italics for books. However, some older guides or teachers might still prefer underlining in handwritten work. It\u2019s always smart to check which style guide you are expected to follow, especially for academic writing. That said, in professional and digital publishing, italics are the standard.<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>You know that moment when you\u2019re writing and suddenly stop because you are not sure how to format something?
