Nowadays, you have your pick of several online companies willing to take your manuscript as long as your digital files meet certain formatting requirements.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though self-publishing is becoming the preferred route for emerging authors, there are certain setbacks. Usually, the biggest source of stress in self-publishing is financial &#8211; once you have found the editors, graphic designers, distributors, and retailers for your manuscript, you might stop dead in your tracks to realize that between building your team and getting your book printed, the cost really adds up. Even with DIY publishing strategies like uploading your manuscript to the Kindle database or boutique companies that allow small batch printing, you will undoubtedly end up spending thousands of dollars before you ever make a cent back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The other resource that publishing ravages is time. The editing process alone can take months, and typically, self-publishing companies take several months to edit, proofread, design, and print copies of your book.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-91774\" src=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/quick.png\" alt=\"Publish a Book Quickly With BooxAI\" width=\"553\" height=\"552\" srcset=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/quick.png 706w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/quick-300x300.png 300w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/quick-150x150.png 150w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/quick-600x599.png 600w, https:\/\/spines.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/quick-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Publish a Book Quickly With Spines<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enter the newest kid on the block &#8211; Spines Publishing.
