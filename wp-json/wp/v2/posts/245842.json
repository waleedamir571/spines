They\u2019re like that old sweater you love but know you should probably retire. Sure, they\u2019re comfortable, but they don\u2019t do your story any favors. Whether it\u2019s the \u201cdamsel in distress\u201d or the \u201clove triangle,\u201d using clich\u00e9s can make your writing feel stale and predictable. To truly captivate your audience, it&#8217;s crucial to avoid cliches and deliver unique, engaging stories. But don\u2019t worry\u2014every writer stumbles into them at some point. The good news? You can break free from these overused tropes and bring your story to life in a fresh, original way. Ready to ditch the clich\u00e9s and create something unique? Read more!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are Writing Clich\u00e9s? And Why Should You Avoid Them?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Writing cliches are those overused ideas, phrases, or plot devices that make a story feel predictable and unoriginal. Think about the \u201creluctant hero,\u201d the \u201clove at first sight,\u201d or the classic \u201cmentor dies\u201d trope. While they might have worked in the past, readers today are craving fresh ideas and new twists.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why should you avoid clich\u00e9s? Simply put, they can make your story blend into a sea of sameness. If readers feel like they\u2019ve seen your plot, characters, or dialogue many times before, they might lose interest quickly. Good writing surprises, engages, and offers something different from the norm. Avoiding clich\u00e9s forces you to think creatively, giving your story originality that will capture your readers\u2019 attention.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> If you\u2019re reading back through your work and think, \u201cHmm, this sounds familiar,\u201d it\u2019s probably a clich\u00e9. Time to rethink that scene or character!<\/p>\n\n\n\t<a class=\"start-for-free\" href=\"\/sign-up\/\" id=\"blog_post_signup_btn\">\r\n        Your Publishing Journey Awaits \u2013 <span class=\"one-block\"><span class=\"for-free\">Start Now<\/span> <i class=\"icon icon-arrow\"><\/i><\/span>    <\/a>\r\n\t\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Identify Common Clich\u00e9s in Your Genre<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every genre comes with its own set of well-worn tropes that can quickly veer into clich\u00e9 territory if not handled carefully. Romance? There\u2019s the infamous love triangle or the brooding bad boy who magically changes for the right girl. Sometimes, authors might even opt to avoid a typical love story altogether to create unexpected narrative twists. Fantasy? You\u2019ve likely come across the \u201cchosen one\u201d destined to save the world, or the grizzled mentor who teaches them the ropes. In thrillers, how many times have you seen the \u201cticking clock\u201d race against time?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trick is not to avoid these familiar elements altogether but to approach them with fresh eyes. Consider giving that \u201cchosen one\u201d a twist, or deconstruct the love triangle by giving it unexpected stakes. Recognizing the clich\u00e9s specific to your genre will help you avoid falling into unoriginal patterns and push you to explore new ways of telling your story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Research books in your genre and pay attention to the common plot devices. Then, brainstorm how you can twist those familiar elements into something fresh and unique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to Spot Clich\u00e9s in Your Own Writing<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Identifying clich\u00e9s in your own writing can be tricky because they often sneak in without you realizing it. You might be so caught up in the flow of your story that you don\u2019t notice when you\u2019ve fallen into familiar, overused territory. But don\u2019t worry\u2014there are ways to spot them.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Start by asking yourself, \u201cHave I seen this before?\u201d If a character feels like a copy of someone you\u2019ve read about a dozen times or a plot twist seems predictable, you may have stumbled into clich\u00e9 territory. Also, be wary of common expressions or stock phrases\u2014things like \u201cher heart pounded in her chest\u201d or \u201che was as cold as ice\u201d often signal that your writing could benefit from more originality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another strategy is to get feedback from beta readers. They can provide a fresh perspective and point out moments where your characters or plot feel a bit too familiar. Sometimes we\u2019re too close to our own work to notice these patterns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> When you spot a potential clich\u00e9, ask yourself how you can add a twist or subvert it to make it feel fresh. Clich\u00e9s can become opportunities for originality with just a bit of creativity! Ensure that every literary device you use makes sense and contributes meaningfully to your narrative.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Refreshing Old Ideas: Turning Clich\u00e9s into Something New<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all clich\u00e9s are bad; they exist for a reason\u2014they\u2019ve resonated with readers for generations. The trick is to take these familiar ideas and breathe new life into them, ensuring that every narrative choice helps push the plot forward. Instead of avoiding clich\u00e9s altogether, think about how you can flip the script or add an unexpected twist.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, take the well-worn love triangle. Rather than the typical \u201cwho will they choose?\u201d dynamic, what if all three characters decide not to choose anyone at all? Or, instead of the \u201cchosen one\u201d trope, what if your protagonist is chosen, but actively rejects the role, forcing another character to step into the spotlight?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another approach is to mix genres or combine unexpected elements. Maybe your fantasy world is filled with magical creatures\u2014but instead of being mystical and majestic, they\u2019re bureaucrats with mundane, everyday problems. It\u2019s all about pushing the boundaries and making your reader see familiar concepts in a new light.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Don\u2019t be afraid to break the rules. Clich\u00e9s can be a great foundation for innovation if you\u2019re willing to experiment and twist them into something that feels fresh and unique.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Developing Unique Characters to Avoid Clich\u00e9s<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the easiest ways to avoid clich\u00e9s in your writing is by creating original, multidimensional characters. A flat, one-dimensional character can quickly fall into clich\u00e9\u2014whether it\u2019s the brooding anti-hero, the damsel in distress, or the wise old mentor. Instead, focus on developing characters that feel real, with unique traits, motivations, and flaws.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask yourself: What makes my character stand out? What drives them beyond the typical tropes? Give your characters unexpected goals, quirks, or conflicts that defy expectations. For example, instead of the classic \u201cperfect love interest,\u201d create someone who has insecurities or makes mistakes that challenge your protagonist in unexpected ways. Sometimes, this could mean the protagonist chooses the wrong person, leading to eventual regret and deeper character development.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Backstory is another powerful tool for making your characters feel fresh. Rather than defaulting to the usual tragic past, consider a backstory that\u2019s rich and complex but doesn\u2019t rely on tired tropes. Maybe your protagonist didn\u2019t lose their family in a dramatic accident, but instead grew up in an ordinary household, giving them unique challenges or perspectives.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Think of your characters as real people, not just plot devices. The more authentic they feel, the less likely they\u2019ll fall into clich\u00e9 traps. Original characters make for original stories!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Crafting Plot Twists Without Falling into Clich\u00e9<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Plot twists are meant to surprise and delight your readers, but if they\u2019re too predictable, they\u2019ll have the opposite effect. The \u201cit was all a dream\u201d twist, or the \u201csecret villain was a trusted ally all along\u201d are prime examples of plot twists that have been done to death. To avoid falling into clich\u00e9, the key is crafting twists that feel unexpected yet believable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best plot twists are ones that, in hindsight, make perfect sense but weren\u2019t obvious to the reader along the way. Start by planting subtle clues throughout your story\u2014hints that, when the twist is revealed, cause readers to think, \u201cOf course!\u201d without feeling tricked. Another approach is to reverse reader expectations. For example, if you set up a character as the obvious villain, turn the tables, and reveal their true motives in a way that feels fresh and logical.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, avoid overcomplicating your plot twists. A common mistake is thinking that more twists equal a better story, but if they\u2019re not well thought out, you risk confusing your readers or veering into implausibility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Great plot twists don\u2019t just shock\u2014they elevate your story and give it new depth. Keep your readers guessing, but ensure the twist feels earned and organic to the story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com\/docsz\/AD_4nXfiTZcCT0_6-YeBNg8ZWkqirPOL7V5aaU98-0N3BnO8g_SJku4nEP0jbsl9GQM1Bxt_nr3ZFL58x_Z1yNwUU4IbPIA5K1uKk4fdAhhxbJu1Pm2bIy7K4Q4vrsdAWA53G7TbJNfxOTJ1qPCWJMsAPFIfR6M?key=O6QdgluMnk0VOL2z8x4STw\" alt=\"Avoid Cliches in Book Writing\"\/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Editing for Clich\u00e9s<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/spines.com\/services\/book-editing\/\">Book editing<\/a> is a crucial step in the writing process, and it\u2019s essential to keep an eye out for clich\u00e9s during this stage. Here are some tips for editing clich\u00e9s:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Take a Break from Your Writing<\/strong>: Before you start editing, take a few weeks off from your manuscript. This will help you approach your work with fresh eyes and make it easier to spot clich\u00e9s. Distance can provide a new perspective, allowing you to see your writing as a reader would.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read Your Work Aloud<\/strong>: Reading your work aloud can help you identify clich\u00e9d phrases and expressions that sound cheesy or unoriginal. Hearing the words can highlight areas that feel too familiar or overused.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use a Style Guide<\/strong>: A style guide can help you identify and avoid clich\u00e9s in your writing. For example, the Chicago Manual of Style has a section on clich\u00e9s and how to avoid them. This can be a valuable resource for refining your language and ensuring originality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Get Feedback from Others<\/strong>: Ask <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Beta_reader\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">beta readers<\/a> or writing groups to review your work and provide feedback on clich\u00e9s. Sometimes, others can spot clich\u00e9s that you may have missed. Fresh eyes can catch what you might overlook.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Use a Thesaurus<\/strong>: A thesaurus can help you find alternative words and expressions to avoid clich\u00e9s. It\u2019s a handy tool for diversifying your language and keeping your writing fresh.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By following these tips, you can help ensure that your writing is original, engaging, and that you avoid clich\u00e9s that can make your work seem unoriginal and predictable.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Breaking Free of Clich\u00e9d Dialogue and Descriptions<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Clich\u00e9s aren\u2019t just found in plotlines\u2014they can easily slip into your dialogue and descriptions as well. Common phrases like &#8220;her heart raced&#8221; or &#8220;he was as cold as ice&#8221; are often overused and can make your writing feel stale. To avoid this, aim to make your descriptions and dialogue as unique and specific to your characters and scenes as possible.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For dialogue, think about how real people talk. Does your character really need to say, \u201cIt\u2019s not you, it\u2019s me,\u201d or can they express their feelings in a more genuine, authentic way? Try to give your characters their own voices, reflecting their unique backgrounds, personalities, and experiences. This adds authenticity and keeps conversations from sounding like recycled lines from other books.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to descriptions, be careful with stock phrases and imagery. Instead of saying someone\u2019s heart pounded in their chest, describe their anxiety in a fresh way that paints a more vivid picture for the reader. Descriptions should enhance the story, not repeat tired metaphors that readers have seen countless times before.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Pro tip:<\/strong> Fresh dialogues and descriptions not only keep your readers engaged, but they bring your characters and world to life. Ditch the clich\u00e9s and let your words reflect the individuality of your story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Avoid Cliches in Book Writing: Embrace Originality and Avoid the Pitfalls of Clich\u00e9s<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Avoiding clich\u00e9s is an essential part of good writing.
